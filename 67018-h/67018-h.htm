<small>THE TRAPPER OF TAOS AND SANTA F&Eacute;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Late</span> one afternoon when the sunlight
was slanting through the trees and wavering
upon the adobe walls of the Pueblo of
Los Angeles, when the only sounds were
the whispering winds in the higher boughs,
and the thrumming of a stringed instrument
from the soldiers&#8217; quarters, a tall Spanish
mule came clattering into the village
with two boys astride its back. They were
bronzed, sinewy looking youngsters; each
held a long barreled rifle.</p>

<p>A barefooted sentry, his piece over his
shoulder, looked up at the sudden sound;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
and as the mule was abruptly checked beside
him, and the two lads slipped from its
back, he whipped his weapon about and
with a brown thumb upon the trigger,
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221;</p>

<p>The elder of the two lads wiped his forehead
with his sleeve; then to the other he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold tight to that old chap, Joe; we
may have further use for him, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; declared Joe, ruefully.
&#8220;He&#8217;s got a back like a buck-saw, and a
gait like a dromedary. And between the
two he&#8217;s the worst thing I ever rode.&#8221;</p>

<p>The elder boy saluted the sentinel.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are strangers,&#8221; he said, in good
Spanish. &#8220;We belong to the trading
schooner &#8216;Gadfly&#8217; now off the coast; and
we are in pursuit of a man named Lopez
who ran away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentry grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;A deserter?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>&#8220;He is. But we don&#8217;t object to that so
much as we do the fact that he&#8217;s a thief as
well. He robbed us, swam ashore, and the
last seen of him he was heading toward
this village.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentry placed the butt of his musket
upon a stone and leaned socially upon the
barrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some strangers in the Pueblo
now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But they are Americans.
And they are not sailors, but trappers.
They came from Taos in New Mexico,&#8221;
wonderingly; &#8220;they crossed the desert
where they might have died of thirst. And
all to trap beaver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lopez is a half-breed,&#8221; said the youth.
&#8220;And he has a scar, made by the slash of a
knife, across his left cheek.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentry shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw no such man,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It may
be that he went with the Hudson Bay men
who I hear were at work on the streams
not far from here about a week ago.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;The man we are after left the schooner
only this morning,&#8221; said the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The se&ntilde;or captain may have seen him,&#8221;
spoke the soldier, helpfully. &#8220;It is his
duty to ask all strangers for their passports.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the se&ntilde;or captain to be
found?&#8221; asked the boy.</p>

<p>The soldier shook his head, shouldered
his piece and prepared to resume his tramp
up and down.</p>

<p>&#8220;At this hour,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the captain is
always asleep. It is his habit. Later, you
can see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe Frazier, from his post at the tall
mule&#8217;s head, laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The habit is a bad one,&#8221; said he in reply
to an inquiring look from his friend.
&#8220;And I think the quicker the se&ntilde;or captain
is broken of it the better. So I think,
Dave, it&#8217;s your plain duty to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dave Johnson turned soberly to the sentry.
In careful Spanish he said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>&#8220;I am grieved to hear that your officer
is asleep. Also I am sorry that under the
circumstances we shall be forced to awaken
him. Give him our compliments and say
that two Americanos are here in a matter
of much haste.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentry stared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake the se&ntilde;or captain! Never! He
would beat me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dave considered, still gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be awkward,&#8221; he decided.
&#8220;And I wouldn&#8217;t care to see it done. So to
save you trouble, I will awaken him
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>And before the astonished soldier could
prevent him, he strode to the door of the
adobe dwelling and began thundering upon
the door. A sleepy muttering was the
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care!&#8221; cried the dismayed sentry,
apparently at a loss as to how to deal with
the situation. &#8220;He has an evil temper,
se&ntilde;or!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>As the knocking went on, the muttering
within swelled into a roar; then the door
was flung open and a squat, heavy-faced
man with small, angry eyes, and a brass-hilted
sword in his hand, appeared. He
glared at Dave, the little eyes seeming to
snap.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you will come
knocking, will you, my brave fellow!
Nothing will do but I must be disturbed,
eh? Not a wink must I get after all the
labors of the day. Very well, se&ntilde;or; we
shall see.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke quietly, but there was a menace
in his tone which did not escape Joe Frazier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Careful there, Dave,&#8221; he called in
English. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s up to something.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little eyes of the Mexican officer now
went to the sentry.</p>

<p>&#8220;And my commands are worth nothing,
are they, my man? I waste my breath
telling you that I must not be disturbed,
and you allow the first rascally Americano<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
who comes along to come thundering at my
door. Very well! It will be your turn
later!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again his glance shifted to Dave. The
young American saluted in stiff military
fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is my
misfortune that I had to break in upon
your slumbers. The fact is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the man stopped him sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We belong to the schooner &#8216;Gadfly.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dave related in a few words the same
story he had told the sentry. The officer
listened, all the time prodding the sun-baked
earth before the door with the point
of his sword; there was a scowl upon his
heavy face, and the small angry eyes looked
red and threatening.</p>

<p>&#8220;A pretty story,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Your passports!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are on board the schooner. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
our hurry to pursue Lopez we forgot
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain showed his teeth in what was
meant for a smile. Unquestionably this
fact pleased him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give the sentry your arms,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You are under arrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dave fell back a step or two.</p>

<p>&#8220;He means business,&#8221; he called over his
shoulder to his friend in English. &#8220;And
once he gets our guns there&#8217;s no knowing
what will happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t give them up until we&#8217;re
sure,&#8221; answered Joe promptly, throwing his
weapon forward as he spoke, and covertly
preparing for any action that might be
forced upon them. &#8220;Talk to him, old boy;
maybe you can bring him around.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Mexican had followed Dave with
cat-like tread; his sword was now held at
arm&#8217;s length, the point not more than a foot
from the lad&#8217;s chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; commanded he. And as Dave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
turned his face toward him once more, the
man went on: &#8220;I have met with impudent
Americanos before this. And I know the
way to deal with them. Lay down your
rifles!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead of doing so, Dave&#8217;s grip tightened
about the stock of his weapon; the officer
saw this and without another word his arm
drew back for a swinging cut. Dave threw
up the barrel of his rifle to guard his head;
the barefooted sentry saw the motion and
read in it peril for his officer, for his musket
lifted instantly, pointing at Dave. But
Joe, in his turn, saw this, leaped forward
and grasped the sentry&#8217;s arm; the muzzle
of his piece was thrown up just as it exploded;
and the captain went staggering
back, fear in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guard! Guard!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Help!
Would you see me murdered! Guard!&#8221;</p>

<p>From the soldiers&#8217; quarters straggled the
guard, as unkempt a lot as one would wish
to see; each grasped a musket, and each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
was much excited by the shot and the sudden
alarm. A horde of Indians, men,
women and children, also made their appearance
and pressed toward the scene of
action. There was an excited hubbub of
voices; the musket barrels shone in the
sun; and the tattered soldiery eagerly fingered
the locks as though anxious to take
up their duties at once. At a word from the
excited captain they formed a slovenly line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Disarm those Americanos!&#8221; directed
the officer. &#8220;And put them under a close
guard. We shall see if our lives are to be
threatened by intruders in this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grim mouths of the Mexican guns
were turned upon the two lads who now
stood with their backs to an adobe wall;
for a moment or two things looked very bad
for them; but then a new element showed
itself which put a new face upon things.</p>

<p>Through the press of Indians, who made
no offer to take a part in the proceedings, a
half dozen buckskin-clad men shouldered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
their way. From their coonskin caps to
their moccasined feet they looked a hardy
lot; and in their faces was that resolution
which comes in time to all those who are
accustomed to face danger.</p>

<p>Each carried a rifle in the hollow of his
arm; and silently they placed themselves
between the two boys and the soldiery.
One of them, a rather small young man
with sandy hair and mild gray eyes, stepped
toward the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a moment, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; said he, in
Spanish. &#8220;If you&#8217;d like to listen, we&#8217;ve
got a word or two to say for the boys, before
your men carry the matter further.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as though the
Mexican officer would order his guard to
fire upon the intruders; but the cool, resolute
air of the men in buckskin caused him
to alter his mind. Holding up a hand in a
gesture which bid his men await his further
commands, he said surlily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, se&ntilde;or, and who are you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>The young spokesman of the party
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! and is it possible that you&#8217;ve
forgotten me so soon?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the Hudson Bay man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>A light seemed to break upon the Mexican.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are of Young&#8217;s band of trappers,&#8221;
said he with a smile which held an under-current
of cunning. &#8220;To be sure. I had
all but forgotten you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young spokesman nodded, good-humoredly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you&#8217;d done so, se&ntilde;or, shows that
we&#8217;ve been giving you little trouble,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;And now,&#8221; with a certain bluntness
of manner, &#8220;let us come to the present
matter. As it happened, we saw the affair
between you and these lads. As far as I
can see they are in no way to blame. It
was your sentry who fired the shot,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; interrupted the commander of
the village. To the sentry he said: &#8220;Rascal,
did you fire your piece?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My officer,&#8221; replied the man, &#8220;I
thought you were&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough!&#8221; snapped the captain. &#8220;I
will see to you later.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a wave of the hand he dismissed
the guard; the men went straggling back
to their quarters; the group of Indians,
puzzled and disappointed, also melted
away; then the captain turned to the
spokesman of the trappers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, se&ntilde;or, I am fair. I want to
do only what is right. Please so inform
your comrades, for I see they know little
Spanish. And then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; here he leaned
forward, with a cunning look in his eyes,
and whispered the remainder of the sentence
into the young trapper&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>But the latter, a frown wrinkling his
forehead, cut him short.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, &#8220;nothing like that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;But consider,&#8221; pleaded the captain;
&#8220;out of good fellowship.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man paid no heed; to his
comrades he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys, back to camp.&#8221; Then to
Dave and Joe he added, &#8220;Get your mules
and come along. I reckon you&#8217;re not just
what I would call safe in this village.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two lads, Joe with his arm through
the bridle rein of the tall mule, trudged
along at their new friend&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a thousand times obliged to you,&#8221;
said Dave Johnson. &#8220;There&#8217;s no telling
what might have happened to us if you
hadn&#8217;t come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trapper smiled boyishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, with a little drawl in
his voice, &#8220;I reckon the captain was a
trifle anxious about you two.&#8221; Then inquiringly,
&#8220;Know much about these
parts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Joe Frazier. &#8220;We&#8217;re just
from on board ship.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>The other nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it was something like that,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If you had known the lay of
the land, you&#8217;d not have been so ready to
tackle the captain. He&#8217;s just the very
person you&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; fought shy of. You see,
the Mexican government has these pueblos,
or Indian villages all along here, and they
don&#8217;t like Americans to come prowling
around and finding out things. If you
haven&#8217;t a passport they&#8217;ll arrest you, steal
everything you&#8217;ve got and drive you out
of the country. Or it might even be
worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We knew that passports were needed,
but we left the schooner in a hurry, and
never gave them a thought. And,&#8221; added
Dave, &#8220;they were very difficult to get in
the first place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trapper chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about getting
them,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Fact is, I never tried.
None of Young&#8217;s men have &#8217;em, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
captain back there&#8217;s been walking on
thorns ever since we&#8217;ve been here trying
to find a way of arresting us.&#8221; Seeing the
boys&#8217; inquiring look, he added, quietly,
&#8220;There&#8217;s eighteen of us in all, and each
one knows a trifle about shooting. So you
see, the captain hasn&#8217;t found the job an easy
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had walked on some little distance,
when he continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;A couple of days ago the captain hit on
a neat little plan. You see some of our
men,&#8221; and his voice lowered a trifle so that
the trappers in advance might not hear,
&#8220;are a kind of a rough lot, and they&#8217;ll drink
if they get the chance. The captain&#8217;s plan
is to give them liquor, and then when
they&#8217;re helpless, take away their rifles and
hatchets and knives, and pen them up
somewhere. Young got wind of it, and
we&#8217;re keeping our eyes skinned until we&#8217;re
ready to take the trail back to Taos.&#8221;</p>

<p>About a mile south of the Pueblo of Los<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Angeles they came upon the trappers&#8217; camp,
a row of huts made of boughs, sod and bark.
A number of buckskin-clad men lay about
upon blankets or buffalo robes; others were
cooking the evening meal at the camp-fire;
while others again were cleaning their rifles
or honing their broad-bladed hunting
knives.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Young, the trader who took out
this expedition,&#8221; said the young trapper.
&#8220;What are your names, boys? I&#8217;ll introduce
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s Dave Johnson; I&#8217;m from Boston,&#8221;
announced that young gentleman.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m Joe Frazier, from Charleston,&#8221;
said the other. Then, curiously: &#8220;What&#8217;s
yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Kit Carson,&#8221; the trapper
informed them; &#8220;once of Kentucky, later
of Missouri, but now of Taos and Santa F&eacute;.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>AROUND THE CAMP-FIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two lads were warmly greeted by
Mr. Ewing Young, the Taos trader and
leader of the trapper band.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rather narrow squeak,&#8221; was his comment,
when told of their misadventure;
&#8220;the captain back there at the Pueblo is
anxious to get his revenge upon an Americano
because of the trouble he&#8217;s had with
us, and you lads would have pleased him
well enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ewing Young was a very well-known
trader and trapper. Some time before he
had sent out a company in search of fur
from Santa F&eacute; toward the Colorado River
country. On their way they were attacked
by an Indian war party; after a desperate
fight against great odds, the hunters were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
forced to fall back and make their way
toward New Mexico once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that just made me fighting mad,&#8221;
said the trapper chief to the boys, &#8220;so I got
together a party of forty Americans, Canadians
and Frenchmen. At about the head
of the Salt River we came on that identical
war party which had so roughly handled
my first company.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit Carson laughed as though at some
amusing reminiscence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw any parsel of humans so
tickled as those redskins were,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;They had licked us once, and they figured
they&#8217;d do it the second time even quicker
than the first.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys were seated upon a bearskin
which one of the men had thrown upon the
ground for them; night was settling and
the camp-fires blazed cheerily; strips of
venison, from the tenderest portions of
bucks which had fallen before the rifle that
day, were being roasted at each fire, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
the savory smell filled the air. The horses
and mules belonging to the outfit were
safely picketed a little distance off; the
adventurers laughed and chatted and performed
the duties of the camp in high good
humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon, Cap&#8217;n,&#8221; said one old grizzled
fellow with a wrinkled, weather-beaten face
and the clear eyes of a boy, &#8220;that them
thar reds hadn&#8217;t any idee how many there
was of us. If they had they&#8217;d not been in
such a precious hurry to come to hand
grips.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the captain didn&#8217;t want them to
know,&#8221; Kit Carson informed the boys.
&#8220;He picked out a nice likely place and put
about twenty-five men there in ambush.
The Indians off there in front noticed us
halt to do this, and got it into their heads
that we were kind of chicken-hearted in
the matter. And as the rest of us started
toward them they made a charge. We fell
back until they were well into the trap.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Then the boys in the ambush jumped up
and gave them one volley; and away went
the whole band of warriors as fast as they
could go, and never once looked back to
see what had happened to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I counted fifteen braves who&#8217;ll never
draw another bow &#8217;cept in the Happy Hunting
Grounds,&#8221; said the grizzled old trapper.
&#8220;And besides that, there were the wounded.
That&#8217;s the way to hit at the varmints; and
it&#8217;s the only way to make it safe for a white
man to set his traps along the streams in
this region. Teach &#8217;em a lesson, says I;
and make it one that they&#8217;ll not forget,
while you&#8217;re about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But while the savages were defeated they
were not altogether discomfited; for they
doggedly held to the trail of the trappers.
Along the Salt to the San Francisco River,
they had pursued them, and all the way
along this stream to its very head waters;
their depredations were secret and under
cover of darkness; the men learned to avoid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the camp-fires, for at any moment a deadly
arrow might come hissing from the darkness;
horses and mules were killed and
maimed; traps were stolen constantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The loss of the traps crippled us,&#8221; said
Kit, &#8220;and at the head of the San Francisco,
Mr. Clark split the party in two; only what
you see here continued on through the
desert; the others took what pelts we&#8217;d
trapped and turned face about for New
Mexico.&#8221;</p>

<p>During all the talk of the company&#8217;s adventures
and through the supper which
shortly followed, Kit Carson noticed that
the two boys were strangely silent. Now
and then they showed an interest in what
was said by the trappers about them; but
for the most part they sat looking into the
fire or talking in a low tone. But when
the meal was done and the men broke up
into small knots about the fires, the two approached
the young trapper. They talked
for a space upon different topics, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
finally, after some little hesitation, Dave
Johnson said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Being from Taos, you might know a
half-breed Mexican named Lopez.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit Carson smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;seeing that half the
Mexicans down that way are half-breeds, it
would be a hard way to pick a man. But
the name Lopez is not the same as Smith
or Jones,&#8221; he added thoughtfully. &#8220;What
kind of a man is your half-breed for looks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather well made, wears rings in his
ears and has a knife cut across his left
cheek.&#8221;</p>

<p>A gleam of surprise came into Kit Carson&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the man anything to do with your
being here?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has,&#8221; said Joe Frazier. &#8220;We are in
search of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought something was wrong from
the way he acted when I saw him at noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw him!&#8221; Both lads came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
their feet, their rifles in their hands.
&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said the trapper, quietly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t get excited. It&#8217;ll do you no good,
for you couldn&#8217;t go looking for him to-night,
anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as the boys resumed their seats on
the bearskin, he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know this breed by the name
of Lopez. I&#8217;d seen him often at the trading
posts and the Indians called him Spotted
Snake. To-day as I was riding back to
camp here, with some small game that I&#8217;d
been after, I met him on a badly winded
horse. I was surprised to see him so far
away from his usual hunting grounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hello, Spotted Snake,&#8217; says I to him.
&#8216;What are you doing here?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;At first he set out to make believe he
didn&#8217;t know me and that I must have made
some kind of a mistake. But in a couple
of minutes he saw that it wouldn&#8217;t do, and
climbed down to real facts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>&#8220;&#8216;You with some trappers?&#8217; says he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Young&#8217;s crowd,&#8217; says I.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Does he want another man?&#8217; he says.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I know that Spotted Snake is a
good trapper, so I says to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Maybe.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good,&#8217; says he. And then: &#8216;Going
away from here soon?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not for a week,&#8217; says I.</p>

<p>&#8220;And with that,&#8221; said Kit Carson, his
eyes on the boys, &#8220;he lost all interest in
joining us. A few hours later I saw him
headed south with a band of Pueblos and
Mexicans who had been making ready for a
big hunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence; then Dave
Johnson asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of a country is it to the
south?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine country if you stick to the water-courses.
Lots of game; and,&#8221; as an afterthought,
&#8220;lots of redskins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; said Dave to his friend,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
&#8220;we&#8217;ll send the mule back to the man we borrowed
it from. Then we&#8217;ll each buy a horse
and some other things that we need, and
we&#8217;ll be off to the southward after Lopez.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit Carson regarded the lads quizzically.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll take a good trailer to follow that
party with any chance of overtaking them,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;And outside that, it&#8217;s a mighty
dangerous thing for two people to get out
there without anything to back &#8217;em up.
The reds would gobble &#8217;em quicker&#8217;n it
takes to tell it.&#8221; He studied them for a
moment longer and then said quietly, &#8220;If
the thing&#8217;s not too much of a secret, let&#8217;s
hear it. You&#8217;ve got a reason for wanting to
come up with Spotted Snake; and, who
knows&mdash;maybe if it&#8217;s a good enough one&mdash;I
might be able to help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; said Joe, sturdily,
&#8220;every person we&#8217;ve met to-day has to
listen to our troubles. But I guess,&#8221; comically,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll have to saddle you with the
story, too, Mr. Carson, if you&#8217;re to understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
how we came here and what we&#8217;re
after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been all of six months ago,&#8221;
spoke Dave, &#8220;though I&#8217;ve about lost track
of the time, that we left New Orleans in the
bark &#8216;Gloria Santos.&#8217; She traded all along
the coast until we came to Rio Janeiro;
then we shifted to the English square rigger
&#8216;North Star,&#8217; which carried us around the
Horn and to Valparaiso. At that city we
got passage on the trader &#8216;Gadfly,&#8217; which
worked along until we reached the mouth
of the Los Angeles River.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You came alone on this trip?&#8221; asked
the trapper.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought,&#8221; said Kit.
&#8220;But go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father&#8217;s been thinking of making
the voyage for the past five years,&#8221; said Joe.
&#8220;And he thought he&#8217;d wait until Dave and
I were old enough to join him. Dave and
I are cousins, you see.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>&#8220;But we never knew what his object was
until we reached this coast,&#8221; said Dave.
&#8220;Then we found that he had a sort of map
or plan of a particular place on a California
river, which had been given him by an
old seaman for whom he had done an important
service while they served under
MacDonough on the Lakes in the last war
with England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plan of a place on a river, eh?&#8221; spoke
Kit. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve trapped along all these
streams and while they&#8217;re good for beaver
and other fur bearing critters, still I don&#8217;t
see anything about them that would take a
man all that way a-looking for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dave glanced about at the groups of trappers
as though to make sure that he was
not overheard; bending forward he whispered
something in Kit Carson&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; exclaimed the trapper, incredulously.</p>

<p>Both boys nodded a vigorous affirmative.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old seaman who gave my uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
the map,&#8221; said Dave, &#8220;had visited the country
years ago. He was sure that there were
great quantities of gold in the beds of all
the streams. He was very old when my
uncle met him, and that is why he didn&#8217;t
make the venture himself. The map was
made by him on a spot where he had seen
the Indians washing out gold to make ornaments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be so,&#8221; said Kit, slowly. &#8220;They
find it just that way, I&#8217;m told; so why not
in California as well as any other place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The captain of the &#8216;Gadfly&#8217; was short
handed when we got to a village down the
coast, and he hired a Mexican and this
half-breed, Lopez, to help work the
schooner. The Mexican deserted at the
next stop, but Lopez remained with us.
In a little while we found why this was.
Things began to be missed. Two nights
ago as I came on deck I found him lying
on his stomach looking down the open skylight
into my uncle&#8217;s cabin. There was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
light burning in the cabin and my uncle
sat at a table with a small metal box before
him, going over its contents. It was in
this box that he kept the map and his
other valuables. I spoke to Lopez; he
got up, muttered something and walked
away. This morning the half-breed was
missed; a half hour later the box was also
discovered to have disappeared. It took us
only a moment to put the two things together;
then Joe and I put out on board
the mule, looking for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father didn&#8217;t join in the hunt?&#8221;
said Kit to Joe, and there was an inquiring
note in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;isn&#8217;t able to
ride. He&#8217;s a cripple; lost his right leg by
a cannon shot at the engagement on Lake
Champlain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Kit. &#8220;And if the map was
to be recovered, it was for you two boys to
do it.&#8221; There was a short silence; then
the trapper spoke again. &#8220;I see now why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Spotted Snake was so anxious to get away
from this section as soon as he could.&#8221;
Then inquiringly, &#8220;Is it your idea that
he took the box just because of the money
value of the things in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t have known of the
map&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Joe breathlessly. But
the trapper interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure of that,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;You are never sure of what a fellow like
that knows. He goes sneaking about, peeping
and listening, and often he finds out
more than he&#8217;s given credit for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dave was about to make a reply to this,
when suddenly there was a commotion in
the darkness. The voice of one of the
trappers posted to the north of the camp
as a guard was heard calling sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt! Stand where you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly the groups about the fires
melted; each man seized the ever ready
rifle and fell back out of the red glow.
The chief of the trappers, Mr. Young, went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
forward, and voices were heard in a sort of
parley. Then the two boys saw the captain
of the Pueblo advancing, a half dozen
of his soldiers at his back.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Pardon!</span>&#8221; cried the Mexican, jovially,
as he advanced. &#8220;I hope I do not intrude,
gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief of the trappers, who had approached
the fires with him, bid him welcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said Mr. Young. &#8220;Glad to
see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer did so; and his men squatted
within the circle of light, blinking like so
many owls and holding their muskets
across their knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon you will be leaving the Pueblo,&#8221;
said the captain. &#8220;I am sorry. Not once
have you accepted my hospitality.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grizzled old trapper who had spoken
to the boys when the company&#8217;s venture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
was being related, laughed at this declaration
when it was translated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble with that Greaser is that he is
too public in his invitations,&#8221; grinned he.
&#8220;If he wants to treat us so consarned bad,
why don&#8217;t he do it privately? I reckon nobody
here&#8217;d refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a laugh at this; and one of
the Americans who spoke some Spanish
called to the captain across the firelight:</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, se&ntilde;or, if you want to be
sociable, we&#8217;ll not discourage you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Mexican smiled in an oily fashion
and rubbed his thick, strong hands. He
spoke English very badly, but at once
entered into a conversation with some of
the men.</p>

<p>Kit Carson, who, with the two boys, had
not returned to the camp-fire at the officer&#8217;s
approach, stood leaning upon his rifle,
watching the strangers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up to some of his games,&#8221; the lads
heard him mutter. Then to them he said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
&#8220;Move quietly and follow me; I reckon
I&#8217;ll be able to show you the reason for the
captain&#8217;s visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Softly he stole away westward from the
camp, the boys following in his steps; when
about two hundred yards distant he made a
d&eacute;tour toward the south and after some
little time paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the Greasers took this way when
they approached,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Then slowly he stepped along in the
direction of the distant firelight; the night
was a moonless one, but the stars twinkled
in the light-colored sky and they were
enabled to see without difficulty. Quietly
they paced along among the trees, until at
length the trunk of a giant cottonwood
reared itself a little to one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the trapper, &#8220;I think I
noticed that tree before.&#8221;</p>

<p>They approached it; upon the far side it
showed a large hollow at the base. The
long rifle barrel was poked into this and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
struck something that gave out an unusual
sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; said Kit, and with that
he put down his gun, reached into the
crevice and rolled out a heavy looking keg.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked the boys, in a
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Liquor!&#8221; replied the trapper. &#8220;And
put here by that Greaser a while ago. And
before he leaves camp to-night he&#8217;ll see to
it that our men know where the stuff is
hidden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what is his object?&#8221; asked Joe,
puzzled.</p>

<p>There was a little pause; the trapper&#8217;s
moccasined feet prodded the keg; then he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, all this region is claimed by
the Mexican government. A license is
needed to hunt and trap hereabout. And
they refused to grant one to an American.
When we reached here the captain undertook
to arrest us, but we showed fight.
Ever since then he&#8217;s been trying to get our
fellows intoxicated; once let him succeed,
and the rest will be easy for him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_43.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;WHAT IS IT?&#8221; ASKED THE BOYS</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>He drew a heavy, short-handled hatchet
from his belt. With one blow the head of
the keg was stove in; the strong liquor
rushed out and sank into the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; said Kit, humorously, replacing
the hatchet in his belt, &#8220;there&#8217;s that to
set against the captain&#8217;s little game. There&#8217;s
not enough left to make even a tarantula
feel lively.&#8221;</p>

<p>They took the same way back to camp;
no one had missed them; and they found
the Mexican officer all smiles and ready to
leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Se&ntilde;or Young,&#8221; he was saying
to the leader of the trappers, as he
shook his hand. &#8220;Good-night and pleasant
dreams. To-morrow, in the morning, I will
come again.&#8221; He said this with an unpleasant
smile which made Kit Carson
nudge Dave Johnson meaningly. &#8220;In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
morning I will come again; and from then
on, se&ntilde;or, I hope to see much more of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; said Young.</p>

<p>The Mexican hitched his sword belt into
a more comfortable position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, gentlemen,&#8221; said he, with
a wave of his hand to the trappers. &#8220;You
are all brave fellows; and like brave fellows
the whole world over, you accept all that
circumstances put in your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>As this was put into English for them by
the comrade who knew Spanish, the men
laughed and exchanged mysterious nods
and winks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Kit, &#8220;he&#8217;s got them
primed to fall into his trap. And they&#8217;d
do it as sure as shooting&mdash;if&#8221;&mdash;and he
laughed softly&mdash;&#8220;the trap was not already
sprung.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a final wave of the hand, the Mexican
officer strode away followed by his
men; and no sooner had he disappeared
than Kit was at the side of his employer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
telling of the plot. Mr. Young&#8217;s face grew
dark with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to repay him for that,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;But,&#8221; with a gesture, &#8220;what&#8217;s the use? I
suppose, after all, it&#8217;s his way of doing his
duty.&#8221; Then with sudden resolve, &#8220;There
will be a constant danger of that kind all
the time we are here; so at sunrise to-morrow
we break camp and head for the
Gila River.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the leader turned away, Kit Carson
turned swiftly to the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, so there you are!&#8221; said he. &#8220;You
have the luck with you, boys. It&#8217;s the best
chance that could turn up. Come with us
and you&#8217;ll be following right in the trail of
Spotted Snake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my father,&#8221; cried Joe, as he caught
his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got an Indian boy here that&#8217;s
been hanging around camp,&#8221; said Kit.
&#8220;He&#8217;s to be trusted. Send him back with
your mule, and also write a message to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
father. Tell him to come ashore and hire
a couple of Pueblo Indians to carry him in
to the Mission of San Gabriel. The priests
will look after him; they have good food
and he&#8217;ll be safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Dave, &#8220;couldn&#8217;t we start for
the coast now and make arrangements with
him in person? It&#8217;s only a little more than
thirty miles there and back. We could
make camp again by sunrise.&#8221;</p>

<p>This seemed to strike Kit as a good notion;
he sought out Mr. Young and put the
case of the boys before him. The chief
trapper nodded, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the idea of greenhorns,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;And then we&#8217;re out to catch fur,
and not to trail thieving half-breeds. But
if the thing&#8217;s important and there&#8217;s no
other way of doing it, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Kit, to the boys, &#8220;as there
isn&#8217;t any time to lose, let&#8217;s see to your
mounts.&#8221; He led them to the place where
the horses were picketed; the animals lifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
their heads at the approach of the trapper;
some snorted and pawed the ground as
though anxious to be off on the trail once
more. Mr. Young pointed to a pair of fair
sized mustangs which stood side by side.</p>

<p>&#8220;They ought to do,&#8221; said he. &#8220;They
are sound, not excitable and have speed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t have made a better pick if
you&#8217;d gone over the entire lot,&#8221; said Kit,
approvingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t we be depriving some one of
a mount?&#8221; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Horses are plenty in this country; and
cheap, too. You can have these for the
price we pay for the ones we buy to replace
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was eagerly agreed to; there was
little more said; the mustangs were led out,
bridled and saddled; and the boys, good
riders both, swung themselves upon their
backs.</p>

<p>&#8220;By daylight,&#8221; cried Dave, as he waved
his hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>&#8220;And if we&#8217;re a little late,&#8221; called Joe,
his impatient mount prancing under him,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll try and pick up your trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good lads,&#8221; laughed Kit Carson; and
then with another salute they were gone
into the darkness.</p>

<p>A strong guard of trusty men was kept
about the trappers&#8217; camp that night; Mr.
Young was an experienced frontiersman
and so took no chances with an enemy of
the Mexican captain&#8217;s type. No one was
permitted to leave camp for fear that the
keg discovered by Kit was not the only
one &#8220;planted&#8221; by the cunning official.
At the first streak of dawn the trappers
were astir; breakfast was cooked, traps and
other equipment packed upon the horses
used for that purpose, and everything was
ready for the start.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks as though our young friends
were going to fail us,&#8221; spoke Mr. Young.
&#8220;If they do, I&#8217;m out the price of two good
ponies.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>&#8220;They&#8217;ll not fail unless something happened
them on the way,&#8221; said Kit Carson,
who had taken a fancy to the cousins.
&#8220;They are a clean-looking pair, and I
think I&#8217;d back them to do more than hold
to a bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trappers, with their packhorses in
the center of the column, moved off down
the Indian trail; they had gotten entirely
out of sight of the Pueblo of Los Angeles,
when a distant shout caught the ear of
Kit Carson; his sharp eye swept the hills
which rose about them; across a ridge to
the north two horsemen were coming like
the wind.</p>

<p>The trapper wheeled his mustang and
dashed back; the newcomers were Dave
and Joe, weary and sore from the unaccustomed
labor of the night, but both game
and willing, for all.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all right,&#8221; proclaimed Joe, delightedly.
&#8220;Dad didn&#8217;t take to the thing
at first, but we had him talked over in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
half an hour. The captain of the schooner
knows a priest at San Gabriel; they are
going to get a party of the mission Indians
with ponies and a litter as you suggested;
and he&#8217;ll stay at the mission till we return,
or he hears from us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cavalcade reached the Mission of
San Gabriel in the afternoon. This mission
was the most wonderful sight in the
Californias of that period. It had farming
land stretching for miles about, tilled by
the thousand Indians which it maintained;
over its ranges wandered seventy-five thousand
head of cattle, also huge herds of
horses, mules and sheep. Mr. Young had
no difficulty in replacing the ponies sold
to the boys; horse-flesh was low as he had
said, and, especially at San Gabriel, very
plenty.</p>

<p>Kit Carson earned the friendship of a
young Pueblo, loafing on the steps of the
mission building, by presenting him with
a small trinket.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>&#8220;Some Mexicans and Indians went
through here yesterday,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trap!&#8221; said the youthful savage, laconically.
&#8220;Much hunt on Gila River.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man was with them&mdash;much cut on
face,&#8221; and the trapper illustrated the character
of the scar.</p>

<p>The young Indian nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Big cut!&#8221; agreed he. &#8220;Long time
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit nodded to the boys as they turned
and rode after their party.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re right behind them! If we have
good luck, Lopez, or Spotted Snake, as we
called him in Taos, will be where we can
get our hands on him by sundown to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>INDIAN SIGNS&mdash;AND INDIANS!</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night the trappers camped upon
the banks of a small stream; their supper
was of game shot during the day and corn-cakes
made from the meal in one of the
packs.</p>

<p>Both boys noticed that much care was
taken as to the picketing of the horses,
also a guard was placed over them. The
camp was laid out with a plain regard for
defense as well as for comfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never can tell in the wilderness
just what is going to happen,&#8221; said Kit
Carson, in answer to a question of Joe&#8217;s.
&#8220;The Pueblo Indians are mostly a mild
lot, and never go upon the war-path; and
the other redskins are too well fed around
the mission to make trouble. But war<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
parties of one nation or another are apt to
be met with any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trappers placed their saddle pads on
the ground and threw their blankets over
them; these, with saddles at one end for
pillows, were their bed. The boys followed
their example.</p>

<p>&#8220;But keep yourself out of the firelight,&#8221;
warned Kit. &#8220;It&#8217;s a dangerous habit to get
into, this hanging around the camp-fire.
And always keep your rifle where you can
reach it the first grab. Seconds count in a
night rush of these copper-colored varmints;
so always fix yourself right before you go
to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men talked and smoked their pipes
about the fire for an hour or two after
supper; then, after a guard had been set,
they, one by one, rolled themselves in their
blankets and soon were asleep. For some
time, however, the boys lay awake; the
crackling of the logs on the fires, the stamping
of the horses, and the stirring of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
breeze in the trees was new to them; and
then from the hills and the forests the faint
voice of the wilderness called to them as it
calls to every one, telling of its rushing
rivers, its trackless wastes, its splendid
game, its breathless dangers. And, also,
somewhere ahead was Spotted Snake, and
as they grew heavy eyed and slow of
thought, they seemed to realize for the first
time what the pursuit of him in such a
region as this might mean; months might
go by without a sight of him, and many
and nameless perils might be met by the
way.</p>

<p>At dawn on the following day the camp
was astir; breakfast was cooked and eaten,
packs were adjusted and made fast; then
the party mounted and began the day&#8217;s
journey. It was a picturesque cavalcade;
each man led or rode beside a packhorse or
mule; across his back was slung his rifle, in
his belt was his hunting knife, his whetstone
and his hatchet; his clothing was of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
soft buckskin, fringed and ornamented with
porcupine quills, dyed in many and brilliant
colors.</p>

<p>The country through which they passed
was an ever changing one; streams were
crossed; paths were forced through green
ravines; mountainsides were conquered;
thick woods were encountered everywhere.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the day the boys
found themselves riding ahead of the trapper
company, with Kit Carson; after a time
he grew silent and seemed to be studying
the ground as they went along. At length
he drew in his pony and waited until Mr.
Young came up.</p>

<p>&#8220;The signs say that a company of trappers
went over this route not long ago,&#8221; he
said to his chief. &#8220;And I think it might
be Spotted Snake and the party he engaged
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like as not,&#8221; replied the other, his eyes
searching the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;The trail leads away to the left a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
piece on,&#8221; observed Kit. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll have
a look at it with the boys. We&#8217;ll bring up
with you in a little while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon a nod from Mr. Young he rode
forward, the two eager lads at his side;
they also studied the ground; hoof marks
there were to a certainty; but what told Kit
they had been made by a trapping party,
they were puzzled to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s plain enough,&#8221; said the young man
when Joe had put the question to him.
&#8220;Each man in the party rode a pony and
led a pack-mule; no other party but a trapper&#8217;s
is ever made up like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Off to the left they turned, following the
trail as it led toward a distant range of
hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather a peculiar move,&#8221; spoke Kit
after a time; &#8220;and no direction for a company
to take which aims to trap on the
Gila River.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a full hour they rode in the track of
the strange preceding expedition; they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
reached a section covered by small knolls or
hillocks, some crowned by growths of
dwarfed trees, others bald and desolate.
Suddenly Kit Carson reined in his pony
and swung himself from the saddle; without
waiting to be told, both boys did the same.
They quickly led their mounts behind one
of the knolls; and when the trapper halted,
Dave Johnson asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tie up your mustangs,&#8221; was the only
reply.</p>

<p>The boys did so; then, following the
cautious example of the trapper, they
scrambled up the steep sides of the hillock;
it was one of those upon which the dwarf
trees grew so thickly; they lay among these
and looked toward the east.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a steady look now, off toward the
southeast,&#8221; said Kit, one hand pointing in
that direction. &#8220;Do you see a hill which
looks something like a horse&#8217;s head&mdash;right
against the sky?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>The thick mass of dark growth which
topped a distant knoll was unmistakable;
and both lads replied in a breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, strike a line to the left again&mdash;on
a hill farther away&mdash;a bald hill something
higher than the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe Frazier was the first to catch the
object indicated.</p>

<p>&#8220;A horseman,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;An Indian!&#8221; cried Dave Johnson, an
instant later, and with a keener vision.</p>

<p>&#8220;An Indian it is,&#8221; spoke the trapper, his
eyes holding to the distant figure.</p>

<p>There was something in his manner
which caught the attention of the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were Indians a-plenty back at
San Gabriel and at the Pueblo,&#8221; said Joe,
&#8220;but you did not pay much attention to
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit Carson smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, quietly. &#8220;Those redskins
didn&#8217;t call for much attention. But this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
one of a very different kind. You never
catch his sort planting or plowing or tending
cattle; he&#8217;s a warrior, and if you were
close enough to him I think you&#8217;d find that
he is armed with lance, bow and arrow and
tomahawk.&#8221;</p>

<p>The savage horseman was so far away
that he made but a tiny speck against the
sky; but for all that he was an ominous
figure in that desolate land, a sort of symbol
of the danger it held for the intruding paleface
and an unspoken threat of what would
befall if he dared to press further into a
region never meant for him.</p>

<p>For some time the warrior sat his horse
in perfect stillness; it was as though he
were surveying the country round about
for signs of danger, or, more probably, for
signs of prey. Then he suddenly turned
his horse and disappeared from the summit
of the knoll.</p>

<p>The three mounted once more and continued
in the trail they had been following;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the boys noted that the trapper looked at
the priming of his rifle, and they did the
same. They had no notion of what to
expect ahead; but that their guide considered
it more or less serious was plain.
Another hour went by; then they reached
the bald hillock upon which they had seen
the solitary brave. In a hollow about a
hundred yards away was the remains of a
large camp, the fires of which were still
smouldering; all about it the ground was
trampled by the hoofs of hundreds of horses.
From the top of the hillock Kit Carson
studied the scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must have been four or five hundred
redskins camped here up to a few
hours ago,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The brave we saw
was about the last to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the trappers with Lopez, or Spotted
Snake, are among them,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;They
have walked right into a trap, for their trail
leads into the Indian camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the trapper shook his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;There were Indians and half-breeds in
that company of trappers,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
they are mostly on good terms with the
others of their kind. And the fact that
they left the track that would have taken
them to their hunting grounds, and took
one leading straight to the big redskin
camp, shows that they knew of it and made
for it of their own accord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; asked Dave.</p>

<p>The trapper shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said he. &#8220;There may
be a thousand reasons for it; but we&#8217;d never
guess one of them, like as not, if we tried
for a month.&#8221;</p>

<p>They spent a few minutes examining the
Indian camp; then they rode back at a
smart pace until they struck the trail of
their own party. When this was overtaken
it was found to be encamped for the night.</p>

<p>After supper, Dave and Joe noticed Kit
in earnest conversation with the chief
trapper. The two men talked in low tones,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
but now and then the boys caught a
disconnected word. &#8220;Indian&#8221; was one of
frequent occurrence, &#8220;war party,&#8221; &#8220;trail,&#8221;
and such fragments gave them something
of the color of the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem to think that there&#8217;s danger
in the air,&#8221; said Joe in a whisper.</p>

<p>The two, having in mind Kit&#8217;s warning,
sat beyond range of the firelight; the
trappers were as usual gathered in groups;
a vigilant guard was stationed off in the
darkness upon each side of the camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s the size of the Indian
party,&#8221; spoke Dave to Joe. &#8220;Here there&#8217;s
only a score of us; what chance should we
have against, say five hundred, if they made
up their minds to attack us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much, I guess,&#8221; replied Joe, soberly.
&#8220;But, after all,&#8221; with a hopeful note in his
voice, &#8220;it&#8217;s not likely that the redskins
know we&#8217;re around. And their trail as
they left their camp led directly away from
us. I noticed that particularly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>However, the trappers&#8217; camp was one of
precautions that night; the horses were not
only picketed, but hobbled as well to prevent
a stampede.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fav&#8217;rite little game with the
reds,&#8221; the grizzled old trapper, whose name
was Matthews, informed Dave. &#8220;You see,
we couldn&#8217;t get along without horses to
carry our camp stuff and traps and pelts; so
if they can scare the critters and set &#8217;em off
wild with fright, they&#8217;ve broke up our trip
and got us at their mercy.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the night passed peacefully enough, as
did the next and the next. Nine days after
leaving Los Angeles, the company sighted
the Colorado River. All thought, or all
fear at least, of redskins had left the trappers;
a camp was pitched near the river and the
traps were made ready for an operation
against the beaver.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send a party of seven up-stream and
the same number down,&#8221; said Mr. Young
on their first night on the Colorado. &#8220;The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
others with the two boys I&#8217;ll leave with you
to guard the camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Kit Carson, quietly.</p>

<p>Next morning the parties, taking a few
of the horses, set out to range the river according
to the leader&#8217;s plans. When they
had gone, Kit, with the help of old Matthews,
the boys and the two other men left behind,
picketed the horses upon one side of the
camp; the small bales of fur were built up
in a complete circle, forming a sort of breastwork.</p>

<p>&#8220;An arrow would never get through these
bundles of pelts,&#8221; said Kit as he regarded
the &#8220;walls&#8221; of the camp with critical approval.
&#8220;Even a bullet would have something
of a job doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everything belonging to the expedition,
except the horses, was brought into the
circle of hides. This had scarcely been
done when the camp was startled by a
sudden shout from old Zeke Matthews. He
had been seeing to the mules, and now ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
toward the enclosure, his rifle ready in his
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Injuns!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;A whole tribe
of them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Startled, the little party leaped upon the
rampart of hides. Advancing at a slow,
swinging gallop across the soft turf that
stretched away from the river was a perfect
cloud of redskins.</p>

<small>WHITE VERSUS RED ON THE COLORADO</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> feathered head-dress of many colors
waved gaily above the advancing braves;
the streamers of their long lances danced in
the breeze; their lithe ponies covered the
ground in cat-like leaps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a war party!&#8221; said Kit Carson, as
he eyed the horde keenly. &#8220;But that
makes little difference in this country;
they use the Mexicans they come upon
much as they please&mdash;rob them&mdash;make
them prisoners, or turn them adrift unarmed.
Sometimes even worse has happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said old Zeke, grimly, as he
looked to the priming of his rifle, &#8220;we
ain&#8217;t Mexicans, and I reckon there&#8217;ll be
nothing like that happen here.&#8221;</p>

<p>With one accord, as they reached a point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
within a hundred yards of the camp, the
Indians threw their mounts back upon
their haunches and leaped to the ground;
then about a dozen of them came forward,
signaled the whites, and with much ostentation
laid aside knife and tomahawk, long
bow and quivers of arrows. Then with upraised
hands and every gesture of good-will
used by the red men upon such occasions,
they came toward the fort. As no protest
came from Kit Carson, old Zeke Matthews
looked at him with eyes of wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Kit,&#8221; said he, &#8220;when do you
reckon it&#8217;ll be time to wave them varmints
back?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of letting them come in,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>The old trapper&#8217;s eyes grew bigger than
ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;ve lived most of my
life with Injuns near at hand; but I ain&#8217;t
never got so as I could trust &#8217;em. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
braves look as if butter wouldn&#8217;t melt in
their mouths; but give &#8217;em a chance and
they&#8217;ll have their scalping knives at work
amongst us, quicker&#8217;n you could say Jack
Robinson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Kit Carson, to the boys,
&#8220;this is the band our friend Spotted Snake
and his friends joined some days ago. If
it is, we may have a chance of getting back
your map. And if it isn&#8217;t, why, we&#8217;ll try
to see that no harm is done, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>The half dozen or so redskins who
formed the &#8220;talk&#8221; party were now close
at hand; Kit called to them to halt, and
spoke to them in one of the several Indian
dialects which he knew. In after years this
great frontiersman could hold a conversation
in their own language with any of the
nations which roamed the plains. He was
but twenty years of age during the trapping
venture of Ewing Young to the Californias,
and so had not become as familiar
with the red men as was the case later.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>And so when the &#8220;talk&#8221; party failed to
understand him, he tried them in another
tongue. This too failed; and so he invited
them within the enclosure so that he might
converse with them in the sign language
which almost all Indians know. A tall
brave, evidently a chief, was the first to
enter the fort; he was a sullen-browed
fellow enough, flat nosed, and with a face
pitted by smallpox. But he gestured his
perfect good-will, as did his companions,
holding out their empty hands to show
that they were unarmed.</p>

<p>Curiously they inspected the enclosure;
the great quantity of furs plainly interested
them; the pack-mules, the arms and
camp equipment excited nods and grunts
of appreciation.</p>

<p>Kit was engaged with the chief, endeavoring
to make him understand his signs; the
savage comprehended slowly, his mind apparently
being more given to the treasures
of the camp than what the trapper was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
saying to him. As Kit was asking for
information with regard to Spotted Snake,
both Joe and Dave were eagerly interested,
watching the signs and trying to interpret
the chief&#8217;s replies.</p>

<p>In a little while the trapper felt a hand
placed upon his fringed sleeve; looking
around he saw Zeke Matthews at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judging from the indications,&#8221; spoke
the old trapper, &#8220;I reckon this here chief
don&#8217;t know English. And that being the
case, I make bold to tell you in that language
that there&#8217;s about forty more of them
come inside the fort since you began to talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>That the men would admit any more of
the savages to the enclosure, or even allow
them to approach the wall, had never occurred
to Kit; however, now that he was
aware that they had done so, he showed no
signs of haste or alarm. His quiet gray
eyes ran around among the Indians who
had adroitly wormed their way within the
circle of pelts; coolly he took in all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
details of the scene; calmly he gauged its
possibilities.</p>

<p>The savages, grinning and with growing
aggressiveness, were thronging up and down
within the little enclosure; a second glance
showed the trapper that though the &#8220;talk&#8221;
party may have entered unarmed, the
others had only made the appearance of
doing so. Under their clothes they carried
hatchet and knife, sure testimony of their
intentions. The swift, cool brain of the
young trapper took in this fact and valued
it properly in an instant; and almost as
quickly his plans were made to meet the
peril.</p>

<p>The odds were overwhelming; within the
fort there were ten redskins to each white
man; in all, the savages outnumbered the
hunters almost a hundred to one. But this
fact had little effect upon Kit Carson; his
arrangements were as quiet and methodical
as they would have been had the numbers
been equal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;Go quietly among the men,&#8221; said he to
old Zeke. &#8220;Get them over here with all
their arms; but, whatever you do, don&#8217;t let
the bucks get an idea of what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</p>

<p>The veteran trapper nodded and leisurely
made his way through the throng of savages.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks bad,&#8221; said Dave Johnson.
&#8220;There&#8217;s enough of them to crush us into
the ground just by sheer weight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit Carson nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they were white men,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;there wouldn&#8217;t be anything to do but wait
till we were sure of what they were going
to do&mdash;and then surrender. But, they
being Indians, the thing&#8217;s something different.
Redskins will never take a chance
with death, and that&#8217;s a fact that&#8217;s saved
the lives of many a band of trappers. Let
them be sure that some of them are to die,
and they&#8217;ll begin to play &#8217;possum. Their
style of fighting is to always have the upper
hand. Otherwise there&#8217;s no fight.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>Old Zeke passed the word calmly to his
comrades; and one at a time the men sauntered
across the circle and joined Kit and
the boys. It was as though they had no
object in the movement except to dawdle
about, talk, and encourage their visitors to
make themselves at home. When all six of
the whites were finally together, rifles in
hand, alert and ready for the desperate
chance which meant life or death to them
all, Kit Carson said quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys, when I give the word, each
pick out a head man and cover him with
your rifle. I&#8217;ll take the chief with pock-marked
face. At the slightest movement
that looks like resistance&mdash;fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>The men nodded; the steady gripping of
the rifle stocks alone told of their purpose;
their thumbs were on the triggers; their
eyes were upon the redskins. Then Kit&#8217;s
soft, drawling voice said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke his rifle came to a level, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
muzzle within a few feet of the stalwart
chief; the three trappers and the two boys
followed his example; each of the grim
black tubes stared a savage in the face.</p>

<p>With dismay the Indians fell back into
a huddled mass at one side; not for an
instant did the long rifles waver; in the
barrel of each was a messenger which
meant death; they knew the deadly aim of
the palefaces of the border and that they
seldom missed their mark. The chief with
the pitted face now found a fund of halting
Spanish, and he addressed the trappers.</p>

<p>&#8220;We come as friends! Are not the white
men our brothers?&#8221;</p>

<p>With his cheek against the stock of his
rifle and his gray eye glancing down the
barrel, Kit Carson replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave this camp! And leave it at once.
Stay and you are all dead men.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an instant&#8217;s pause&mdash;an instant
full of suspense; then the chief spoke to his
braves. They made no answer, but gathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
their gay colored robes about them and
sullenly filed out of the little fort; and
they never paused or looked behind until
they were safely out of rifle shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be a grand pow-wow,&#8221; said
Kit, as they watched the great band of
savages join those just expelled from the
fort. &#8220;And if the chief who spoke has the
say, I wouldn&#8217;t wonder if we had a little
fight on our hands before sunrise. He had
fire in his eye as he left.&#8221;</p>

<p>One by one a chief or head man harangued
the redskins; suddenly there was a
chorus of shrill yells and a scattering for
their ponies; then, mounted, they formed a
half circle, and with lances held high and
bows ready for deadly work, they sat facing
the camp of the whites like so many graven
images.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>TWO NIGHTS OF DANGER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> sight of the great array of armed and
mounted savages facing the little fort, the
two lads from the East felt that sinking
sensation which usually comes to those not
bred to physical danger. At the crisis
within the camp neither had felt the
slightest fear; the thing was so sudden and
so desperate that they had no time to think
of themselves.</p>

<p>But this new situation was different; their
minds had time to grasp the consequence
of the attack and they felt uneasy. It is
probable that Kit Carson understood something
of what they were feeling; more than
likely he had once gone through it himself;
at any rate, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;This doesn&#8217;t mean much, lads; the reds
are going to run rings around us, maybe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
and do a little fancy shooting. But they&#8217;ll
keep out of range of our guns, and so, of
course, we&#8217;ll be out of reach of their bows.
They are great fellows for that kind of exhibition.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Kit was mistaken. Instead of
making the attack expected, a man rode
out the half circle of horsemen and approached
the camp&mdash;one hand uplifted, the
palm toward the whites.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; said Kit, his eyes upon
the horseman, &#8220;I know that gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dave Johnson uttered a cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Lopez!&#8221; exclaimed he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down, lads, behind the wall; don&#8217;t let
him see you; I&#8217;ll palaver him and maybe
strike some kind of a bargain for your
property.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly the boys crouched behind
the bales of pelts; Lopez advanced easily
upon his pony until he was within a dozen
yards of the camp. Then he drew rein and
sat grinning amiably at the trappers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>&#8220;Well, Spotted Snake,&#8221; said Kit Carson,
leaning upon his rifle and quietly surveying
the half-breed, &#8220;how is it I find you in
company with a band of hostiles?&#8221;</p>

<p>Spotted Snake grinned more widely than
ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are not hostiles,&#8221; he said, in
Spanish. &#8220;Very good Indians. Mean no
harm. You got frightened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They may be very good redskins, as
you say,&#8221; replied Kit; &#8220;but good or bad I&#8217;d
rather not have many of them around with
hatchets and scalping knives hidden in
their blankets.&#8221;</p>

<p>The half-breed laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t know you&#8217;d take anything
they did in bad part,&#8221; said he. &#8220;They are
not used to dealing with white men, and so
don&#8217;t know their ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit pointed to the crescent of armed
warriors facing the camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that, too, is a sign of good-will,&#8221;
said he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>&#8220;Red Cloud is a big chief,&#8221; said the half-breed,
&#8220;and he is very angry at the way
you&#8217;ve treated him. He&#8217;s mounted his
men and put them in fighting formation
just to show you what he would look like
if he really wanted to do you harm. He
told me to tell you that his five hundred
braves would dash over you as the waters
of a mountain stream dash over the rocks in
the time of freshets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve lived long enough among whites
and have enough white blood in you,
Spotted Snake, to know that talk of that
sort won&#8217;t carry very far. If Red Cloud
wants to see how far his young men can
dash over us let him have them try it on.
We can guarantee him twenty-five dead,
and himself among them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The half-breed grinned and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told him that already,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;But he was bound to have me come and
&#8216;make talk.&#8217; If he could have scared you
in the first place your furs, traps, horses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
and rifles would have satisfied him, I think.
He&#8217;s not a half bad sort of fellow when you
come to know him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A while ago I asked you how you came
to be in company with this band,&#8221; said Kit.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you answered me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The trapping party I went out with
fell in with them about ten days ago.
They made us a good offer of pelts if we&#8217;d
join them in a big buffalo hunt, they not
having any rifles. As it was good business,
the chief trapper agreed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The last time I saw you was at Taos,&#8221;
said Kit. &#8220;How is it I find you away up
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got out on the coast,&#8221; said the half-breed,
&#8220;and joined a ship. But the work
was too hard,&#8221; with his ever present grin.
&#8220;I left them at Los Angeles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! you were the fellow, then,&#8221; spoke
the trapper as though surprised. &#8220;I heard
about your desertion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard?&#8221; and even from that distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Kit saw the man&#8217;s lids narrow into
slits through which his sharp eyes peered.</p>

<p>&#8220;A couple of the ship people were looking
for you; they hinted that you&#8217;d sort
of clung to some property which wasn&#8217;t
altogether yours, when you left.&#8221;</p>

<p>The half-breed nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;They told you that, eh? Well, maybe
it was true and maybe it wasn&#8217;t. But, anyway,
I&#8217;m not sorry for my little voyage on the
sea; it promises to be something that will
pay very well; and that&#8217;s the kind of thing
Manuel Lopez is looking for these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said the trapper, &#8220;the ship
people were willing to pay something down
for what was taken. Would you consider
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lopez, or Spotted Snake, snapped his
fingers airily.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a thing that could hardly be
paid for,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s only a chance,
of course, but it&#8217;s such a big one that ready
money is not much temptation.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>&#8220;It happens that the folks who lost this
property on the ship are friends of mine,&#8221;
said Kit. &#8220;And being friends, I&#8217;m willing
to help them out. Maybe, if money can&#8217;t
buy back the things you&#8217;ve stolen, lead can.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he threw forward his rifle,
the stock against his hip, the muzzle covering
the half-breed. But the latter calmly
sat his horse and looked at the trapper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I came here
under what the Indians regard as a flag
of truce; don&#8217;t forget that I am their
spokesman, and that if anything happens
to me they will take their revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>This result was very well understood by
Kit; to shoot or otherwise harm a man
sent forward to parley by the savages was
a very great indignity and one which would
excite them to the limits of their fury. But
that he held the matter at all seriously was
kept hidden from Lopez.</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw us drive them out of camp
a while ago,&#8221; said he, coolly; &#8220;that ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
to have shown you how much we fear
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another thing,&#8221; said the half-breed,
equally calm, &#8220;even if I had taken the
things you speak of, would I be so great a
fool as to carry them about with me? If
they were of value, wouldn&#8217;t I have cached
them somewhere along the trail?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit Carson knew that Spotted Snake was
a cunning, covetous fellow, brave and willing
to go a long way to carry out his desires.
As the matter stood, he feared that
he had spoiled any chance that the boys
might have had to recover the map, by
putting the man on his guard. He was
considering what he had best do under the
circumstances, when the half-breed shook
his rein and rode nearer the barrier.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Santa F&eacute;,&#8221; said he, &#8220;there is an old
man by the name of Diaz&mdash;Goat Beard, the
Indians call him. He keeps a storeroom
at one side of the town, buys furs and sells
goods of all sorts to the Indians.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;I know him,&#8221; said the trapper. &#8220;An
old rascal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lopez grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But he is very useful
at times. He has often transacted little
matters of business for me in a very capable
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trapper got a glimmer of the man&#8217;s
meaning, but more by his manner than his
words. He nodded, as though he understood;
but he said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; proceeded the half-breed, &#8220;if
you were to go to old Diaz during the summer
when the trapping season is done, some
arrangements could be made in any matter
that you care to speak of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the trapper nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;California is a fine country; but I don&#8217;t
care as much for it as I do for New Mexico,&#8221;
said Lopez. &#8220;And, then, trapping is my
business and not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; but he stopped short,
as though not willing to commit himself to
anything that would definitely incriminate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
him. &#8220;Anyway,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;look for
old Diaz in the hot months; he may have
something to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here he wheeled his horse, calling over
his shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;And remember, Red Cloud is a friend
to the paleface. His brother does him wrong
when he thinks Red Cloud means anything
but good feeling.&#8221;</p>

<p>The spotted pony which the man rode
raced back to the solid crescent of braves.
Whatever Lopez reported had the effect of
dismounting them; they picketed their
horses and went into camp, outside the
range of the white man&#8217;s fire.</p>

<p>The fire at which the supper of the six
was cooked after nightfall was masked so
that the light might not attract a flight of
arrows from any of the bucks who might
be lurking in the darkness. The horses
were well within rifle shot and were hobbled
so that to stampede them would be impossible.
However, a guard was kept over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
them; and during the night not more than
one of the whites slept at a time.</p>

<p>Morning dawned, and they saw the smoke
ascending from the redskins&#8217; camp-fires;
apparently the warriors had remained all
night as they had been at sunset. During
the day Red Cloud and one of his braves
visited the fort and were admitted; the
chief in his halting Spanish protested the
utmost friendship; but all the time the
whites noted his evil little eyes coveting
everything he saw in the camp, and so their
suspicions were not abated. The second
night passed much as the first; the little
party did not dare sleep, for there was no
telling at what moment the quiet of the
night would be broken by the yells of the
red horde, a sleet of arrows, and the leaping
of demon figures over the barricade. At
the beginning of the second day there was
a stir in the Indian camp; preparations
were being made for a movement of some
sort.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;They mean either an attack, or to break
camp,&#8221; said Kit Carson, as he watched them
for a space. &#8220;I am not sure which.&#8221;</p>

<p>The braves swung themselves upon the
backs of the ponies, fully armed as before;
in a sweeping line they faced the little fort,
the ponies snorting and prancing, the grim
riders as still as death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire when they reach a distance of
seventy-five yards,&#8221; said Kit, resting his
rifle barrel upon the wall of furs, and throwing
himself upon the ground. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
then have time to reload. And make every
shot tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>The five remaining rifles were also rested
upon the wall, and the five riflemen sought
cover behind it. The air was charged with
the electricity of a coming struggle; and
when the very moment seemed to have
arrived, there was a shout from the river,
the sound of hoof-beats, and up dashed the
chief trapper, Young, and his six buckskinned
followers. At the sight of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
reinforcements the redskins fell into a sort
of confusion. And while this lasted Kit
explained the situation to Young.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll make any movement
against us now,&#8221; said the head trapper.
&#8220;What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re right,&#8221; replied Kit
Carson. &#8220;If they took two days to make
up their minds to tackle six men, it&#8217;ll take
&#8217;em a week to get to the point of facing
twice that many.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, by that time,&#8221; said Young, grimly,
&#8220;there will be still more of us; for I mean
to break camp, move down the stream, pick
up the rest of the boys and then strike for
the Gila.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half the party set to work, adjusting the
bundles of pelts upon the backs of the mules;
the remainder, with ready rifles, watched the
Indians. When everything was in marching
shape the trappers started along the
river bank. The band of savages followed
in their track during the entire day; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
one by one the remaining trappers were
picked up; and when at last the sun went
down it showed the hostile band encamped
upon a hillside not more than a half mile
away. But now instead of six there were a
full score of deadly rifles between them and
their prey.</p>

<small>HOW THE TRAPPERS RETALIATED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Indian band lighted large fires upon
the hillside that night; the tall figures of
the braves could be seen flitting to and
fro in mysterious activity. The trappers
watched the unusual spectacle for quite a
long time without comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are fixing up some kind of a disagreeableness
for us,&#8221; spoke old Zeke Matthews,
at length. &#8220;And I opine, Cap&#8217;n
Young, that I&#8217;d better take a little scout
out in that direction and see what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the head trapper. &#8220;If
you care to take the risk, Zeke, go ahead.
But I&#8217;m not asking you to do it, mind you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to do this little pilgrimage
for my own private amusement,&#8221; said the
veteran, humorously. &#8220;I always did get a
lot of fun out of a passel of redskins when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
they were getting downright serious at their
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took up his rifle; and a heavy pistol
was stuck in his belt. Then he crept out of
camp and away into the darkness.</p>

<p>Two hours had elapsed when he returned.
He put down his gun and warmed his bony
hands at the cheerful blaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;The varmints are having a mighty interesting
time of it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s a
council fire you see blazing up there on the
hill; and they&#8217;re sitting all around it, smoking
their pipes and making speeches to each
other. Old Red Cloud is anxious to get his
hands on our outfit, I guess; but his braves
want to see their way to getting it without
being hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Council, eh?&#8221; said the chief trapper.
&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll have some kind of action before
long. It will be either one thing or
the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>A powerful guard was placed all about
the camp; but the night went by without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
any hostile sound from that of the Indians&#8217;;
toward dawn the council fire upon the hillside
died down; when the sun finally
showed its great, round, red face over the
top of a distant mountain, the whites, to
their astonishment and relief, saw the camping
ground of the foes deserted. Not a savage
was to be seen anywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a good council!&#8221; spoke Kit Carson,
grimly. &#8220;Either Red Cloud is a wise
chief, or his young men have good eyes for
danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was no trusting the red men,
who were known to be cunning foes; a party
of the trappers set out upon their trail and
followed it for some hours. There was no
sign, by the end of that time, that the retreat
was a ruse; so the trailers returned to camp.
The mules were burdened with their packs
of furs and camp equipment once more,
and again the outfit moved down the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems a hardship to move away from
the place where I know Lopez to be,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Dave Johnson to Kit, as they rode side by
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel the same way,&#8221; said Joe Frazier.
&#8220;In the last hour I&#8217;ve had it on my tongue
a dozen times to say to you: &#8216;Let&#8217;s stay
where we are until we make that rascally
half-breed give up his plunder.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit Carson shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand just how it is, I think,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;But to stay behind here, just the
two of you, would be to throw your lives
away.&#8221; He regarded them seriously for a
moment, and then continued: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
thinking over this little affair of yours, and
about what Spotted Snake had to say; and
I&#8217;ve made up my mind that the best thing
you both could do would be to go right on
to Santa F&eacute;.&#8221; Again he paused for a moment,
then continued: &#8220;Your father&#8217;d be
willing to pay a little to have this map returned,
wouldn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;That is, if we couldn&#8217;t
get it any other way.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>The trapper laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we&#8217;ll try
that other way first. I think it is wrong to
knuckle down to the half-breed&#8217;s demands.
But Santa F&eacute; is the place to get in touch
with him again, one way or the other; and
I think you can ease your mind and leave
this section, knowing that it&#8217;s the best thing
you can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>This sounded like logic to the boys; and
so they put all uneasy thoughts behind
them, and gave themselves up to the labor
and excitements of the trappers&#8217; life. Day by
day the expedition continued down the Colorado,
setting their traps and reaping a big
harvest of beaver fur. When they reached
tide-water they changed the scene of their
efforts to the Gila River, which enters the
Colorado at about this point; and they
trapped along the Gila day after day with
wonderful success until they came to the
mouth of the San Pedro.</p>

<p>At this point the saddle-horses of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
trappers had been pressed into service to
carry the treasure of furs. So fortunate had
the trappers been that with hundreds of
miles of stream before them they had
already reached their transporting capacity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a hardship for us to have to let
this great chance slip,&#8221; said Young one night
at the camp-fire. &#8220;Beaver has never been
so plentiful, and I feel sure that it will
continue so all the way up the river. But
there is no sense in our going on taking furs
if we have no way of carrying them; so the
only thing I can see to do is to take the
trail for New Mexico and sell what we&#8217;ve
got.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Zeke Matthews sat listening to the
head trapper, honing the edge of his great
hunting knife and nodding his head in
agreement with him. But at the proposition
that they leave the remainder of the stream
untouched, and make for their market, he
protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just flying in the face of Nature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
that&#8217;s what it is,&#8221; said he, earnestly. &#8220;Here
we have luck raining down on us; and we&#8217;re
going to turn our backs on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit Carson smiled at the old man&#8217;s indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Zeke,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what else is there
to do? If we have no horses to carry the
pelts, what&#8217;s the use of taking them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get horses,&#8221; returned the old fellow,
laconically.</p>

<p>There was a general laugh from the men
lounging about the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can we get them?&#8221; asked Young,
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Injuns have &#8217;em,&#8221; declared Zeke.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a village less than two hours&#8217; ride
from this camp where there&#8217;s a whole drove
of horses and mules that the reds have
stolen from the Greasers.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence; Zeke rubbed away
at his knife and went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a thieving lot, and it&#8217;d be a just
punishment on &#8217;em to lose the nags. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
that ain&#8217;t all! When we set out on this
trip who went for us tooth and nail but this
same gang of varmints? We punished &#8217;em
for it, but we didn&#8217;t punish &#8217;em enough. If
white men are to come into this country the
redskins must be taught to go easy on the
bow and arrow, and the hatchet and knife.
So I&#8217;m for giving &#8217;em a lesson before we
strike this camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>A murmur went up from the men. The
idea pleased them. They had not forgotten
the attack of the Indians upon their venturing
into the wilderness; and to strike a
blow in retaliation, more especially such a
businesslike blow as that suggested by
Zeke, appealed to them.</p>

<p>Long and earnestly the matter was discussed;
and finally it was agreed upon.
It was a savage country and a rough time;
and the thoughts and opinions of men are
always moulded by their surroundings and
their needs. However it may look to us to-day,
to impress the herd of mules was not from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
the trappers&#8217; point of view at all contrary
to the laws of justice. They regarded it in
the same light as the commander of an
army did the requisitioning of supplies in
the country of the enemy.</p>

<p>Next day a half dozen men were left to
guard the camp; the balance of the party,
with Dave and Joe pressing joyously on in
their midst, set out upon their errand.
After a ride of a couple of hours the band
sighted a large mixed herd of horses and
mules. These were grazing some little distance
up the San Pedro; and a scout or
two was sent to locate the Indian village.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s off to the west, there,&#8221; said old
Zeke. &#8220;I was there once, trading; and
the varmints robbed us of everything we
had.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a short time the scouts returned.
The village, a clutter of dirty huts, lay in
the direction indicated by Zeke; and the
band of buckskin-clad trappers rode toward
it under cover of the timber.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; said Kit Carson, at length
pointing through the trees.</p>

<p>The village lay quietly in the sun; it
was a barren, neglected place; the bucks
lolled in the doorways of the low huts; in
the narrow fields the women were preparing
to plant the scanty crops.</p>

<p>At a word of command the trappers
shouted to their mounts; at full speed they
dashed into the village, their firearms rattling
and snapping briskly. Yells of fear
and rage went up from the savages; they
grabbed up their arms, and their deadly
arrows began to hiss through the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open order,&#8221; called the chief of the
trappers. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ride so close together.
Load and hold your fire until I give the
word!&#8221;</p>

<p>The horses were brought to a standstill
outside the town; the trappers reloaded
their rifles and looked to the state of their
pistols. During this pause in the attack
the savages recovered from their surprise;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
and upon a sort of plain, stretching away
to the river, they rallied their forces. The
village was quite a large one; several hundred
warriors faced the trappers, and from
their furious actions it was plain that they
meant to make a most desperate defense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready?&#8221; called the head trapper.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready,&#8221; was the answer from his
men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your fire till I give the word,&#8221;
said the leader, once more. Then lifting
his hand: &#8220;Charge!&#8221;</p>

<p>Down rode the trappers upon the redskins;
and the latter bent their bows with
practiced hands, the keen eyes of each selecting
a mark.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>KIT REACHES SANTA F&Eacute; ONCE MORE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> open order of the whites and the
rifle fire which came like a thunder clap at
the command of their leader discomfited
the savages; the arrows flew wild, and as
the horsemen came plunging at them, their
small arms crackling, they broke and ran
toward the river.</p>

<p>For perhaps a mile the trappers pursued
them, more to keep them on the run and
discourage another rally than anything
else; then at a shout from Young they
wheeled about and made for the herd on
the other side of the village.</p>

<p>Calmly the victors selected the best of the
animals, some of their number watching for
the possible approach of the redskins. But
the latter were too completely demoralized
to venture an attack, so the trappers rode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
away to their camp leading a full score of
pack animals, sufficient to carry all the fur
they&#8217;d be likely to take, even with the best
of luck, during the remainder of their
work upon the Gila.</p>

<p>&#8220;That kind of a little lesson ain&#8217;t lost on the
reds,&#8221; said old Zeke, after they had reached
camp and were settled down watching their
meat cooking over the coals. &#8220;They won&#8217;t
be so ready to pitch into every company of
whites they see for some time to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>From then on the party continued up
the Gila River until they reached New
Mexico; luck had continued to favor them
and when they finally entered Santa F&eacute;
they had two thousand pounds of beaver
fur.</p>

<p>&#8220;At twelve dollars a pound,&#8221; said Kit
Carson, &#8220;that&#8217;s about&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-four thousand dollars,&#8221; spoke
Joe.</p>

<p>The trapper looked at him admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never had any schooling,&#8221; said he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
&#8220;except what I got from old Kin Cade one
winter up north of Santa F&eacute;. It&#8217;d take me
some time to calculate that; and here you
do it in your head, like a shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was this Kin Cade a schoolmaster?&#8221;
asked Dave.</p>

<p>The trapper laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he was an old fellow I stumbled on
once, away up in the hills when I first came
here. He lived all alone in a hut; and he
knew more about the mountains, about Indians,
animals and fish than anybody I
ever met. He taught me Spanish and a
couple of the Indian languages; also he
showed me how to tan deerskins so that
they would be soft and pliable, to dye
them, to make them into hunting shirts,
leggins and moccasins. Indian feather and
bead work I also got from him. Kin was a
wise old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trappers who had followed Ewing
Young so hardily through all the perils of
the mountains and deserts, of field and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
flood, were now given their share of the
money brought by the pelts; they at once
proceeded to Taos and there the company
disbanded.</p>

<p>However, Kit Carson and the two boys
remained in Santa F&eacute;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spotted Snake is or will be here,&#8221; said
the trapper. &#8220;So we&#8217;ll just look around a
little and see what we can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Santa F&eacute; then had a mongrel population
of some three thousand; its sun-baked
adobe buildings, its gaily clad Mexicans
in trousers slashed to the knees and adorned
with rows of buttons, great sombreros and
high colored mantles; the barbarous peoples
from around about, who came in to trade,
the half-breeds, the picturesquely clad frontiersmen
from the north, all served to give
this city, renowned in the history of the
Great West, a most unusual appearance.</p>

<p>The first morning there Kit Carson
sought out a bronzed old trader who was
outfitting for a trip among the Indians.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;Buck,&#8221; said the trapper, after they had
greeted each other, &#8220;have you seen anything
lately of that &#8216;breed&#8217; they call Spotted
Snake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want of him?&#8221; demanded
the trader, surprised. &#8220;I should think
you&#8217;d be well satisfied to let varmints like
that alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a little matter of business,&#8221; said
the trapper. &#8220;I&#8217;m not hunting him from
choice, but because I must.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trader grunted. From his manner
it was plain to the boys that he held Spotted
Snake in no great esteem.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you must see him, I&#8217;ll do my
best for you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Snake was
seen in the town only a few nights ago; a
couple of my men met him and heard him
doing a lot of wild talking about making a
fortune&mdash;about gold which came so thick
that you could gather it up in buckets.
The sun must have struck through his
sombrero,&#8221; added the trader, drily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>The trapper looked at the boys, and they
returned the look with troubled eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon though,&#8221; went on the trader,
&#8220;if he did have anything valuable, he&#8217;d
put himself in the proper company to get
rid of it. Remember that fellow they
called &#8216;Moccasin&#8217; Williams up in Taos?
Well, he was one of them; and,&#8221; with a
nod of the head, &#8220;I think that speaks for
itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit and the two lads walked slowly down
the narrow street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moccasin Williams, eh?&#8221; said the
trapper, thoughtfully. &#8220;Yes, as Buck
Morgan says, he speaks for himself.
There&#8217;s not a bigger rascal in the southwest.
Once was a miner in old Mexico, I
believe; and later lived among the Blackfeet
and the Comanches. I&#8217;ve even heard
it said that he was a renegade and took part
with the redskins in attacking many a
wagon train.&#8221;</p>

<p>That the man had been a miner interested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
both Dave and Joe vitally. A chill
struck their hearts as they thought of the
brave old veteran of MacDonough&#8217;s victory
who waited away there in the Mission of
San Gabriel for news of his boys and the
map of the treasure country.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;d better go to see the man
Lopez mentioned to you,&#8221; said Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goat Beard?&#8221; said Kit. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;d
been thinking of that. It won&#8217;t do any
harm to go talk to him. The &#8216;breed&#8217;
must have heard that our company&#8217;s got
back, and so knows we&#8217;re around somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>They passed quickly through the town;
at the far side was a squalid section mostly
occupied by Indians and the riff-raff of a
frontier settlement. A wretched sun-baked
adobe house with very low doorways
and a generally forlorn aspect bore
some straggling lettering across the front.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is old Diaz&#8217;s storehouse,&#8221; said Kit.</p>

<p>Inside, the place was deep with shadows.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Cured pelts and buffalo hides were heaped
in corners; traps hung from the ceiling;
rifles, clothing, knives, hardware, pottery
and examples of feather work were displayed
for sale.</p>

<p>A fat old woman, a Mexican half-breed,
came waddling forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;A blessing on the brave Americanos,&#8221;
wheezed she in Spanish. &#8220;You are our
first patrons of the day. Good luck be
with you; and what will you have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Diaz?&#8221; asked the trapper.</p>

<p>The old woman threw up her fat hands
and wagged her fat head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Diaz!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;He is here; but
he is almost mad! Never have I seen him
so wrought up, and I have been married to
him for forty years. But,&#8221; with the facility
of much practice, &#8220;what will you have? I
can buy, sell and trade as well as Diaz.
What will you have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to see your husband,&#8221; said Kit.</p>

<p>&#8220;See him!&#8221; Again the old woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
flourished her hands. &#8220;Impossible, se&ntilde;or!
He will see no one. He has met with a
misfortune!&#8221;</p>

<p>From the back of the storehouse they
now heard a wailing voice lifted to a pitch
of great distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a blight is on me,&#8221; it droned. &#8220;A
darkness is shut down upon me. Never
again will such a chance be mine. To
think of it! A river running with gold&mdash;clear,
yellow, beautiful gold!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the three Americans looked at
each other with quickened interest; the
old woman wrung her fat hands and took
up the wail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Running with gold, se&ntilde;ors&mdash;a large
river whom no one but the Indians have
any knowledge of. And now the paper is
gone. We shall never see it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit Carson leaned his rifle against a heap
of wolf skins; to the woman he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We must see your husband, se&ntilde;ora;
the matter is of great importance.&#8221; Then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
as she shook her head stubbornly, he added:
&#8220;It is about this paper; tell him that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman gave him a greedy look;
then as fast as her unwieldy body would
permit, she scuttled to the rear of the storehouse
and through a curtained doorway.
Beyond this there came a babble of excited
voices; then the woman reappeared followed
by an old man with bent shoulders and a
long, chin beard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;ors,&#8221; squeaked this latter, in a thin,
trembling voice, &#8220;I welcome you. You
have come to bring joy to my old heart,
have you not? You have come with an
offer from the se&ntilde;or of the moccasins?&#8221;
eagerly, as his ratty old eyes ran from one
to the other. &#8220;Sit down. Be comfortable.
Let us approach this business quietly and
with freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trapper folded his arms across his
chest and leaned his shoulders against the
bare clay wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were told by Manuel Lopez to seek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
you out when we arrived in Santa F&eacute;,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;It is on a business about a paper
which he has&mdash;a paper which he took from
the schooner &#8216;Gadfly&#8217; at Los Angeles.&#8221;</p>

<p>The quaking hands of Goat Beard began
to gesture; his halting old tongue was
striving to form a reply, when the curtains
at the rear doorway were once more pushed
aside&mdash;and Lopez himself stood before them!</p>

<p>The half-breed&#8217;s eyes were bloodshot and
feverish; his brown hands trembled as badly
as those of the old man.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are here, are you?&#8221; said he,
after he had stood staring at them for a
moment from the doorway. &#8220;You are
here, and looking for the map.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw up his hands, pressing them
tightly to his forehead; then he began to
laugh in a way that made the flesh of the
two lads creep.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s like a madman,&#8221; whispered Dave
to his cousin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_113.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;SO YOU ARE HERE?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something has happened,&#8221; replied Joe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
in the same low tone. &#8220;And something
that means ill luck for us, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit Carson made no movement nor
answer; he continued leaning against the
adobe wall, his strong arms folded across
his chest. After a few moments the half-breed
recovered from his frenzy; but his
eyes still gleamed, his fingers opened and
shut like the claws on an animal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, nodding his head slowly.
&#8220;I did ask you to come here; and I meant
to deal honestly with you, too. But it&#8217;s too
late! I&#8217;ve been an idiot; and I&#8217;ve been
robbed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of the map!&#8221; Dave Johnson made a
step forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; of the map,&#8221; replied Lopez. &#8220;I
began to boast of the great luck I had. I
showed the map to Moccasin Williams. He
is a miner of experience. He had heard
stories of gold in California, and had always
wanted to go there. Later, while I was
asleep, he robbed me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>He sank down upon a heap of hides, his
hands covering his face; from his manner
one who did not know the merits of the
case would have considered him an honest
man grievously wronged.</p>

<p>&#8220;A river of flowing gold,&#8221; wailed Goat
Beard. &#8220;Yellow, beautiful gold! And
now we will never know where it is. We
shall never see it&mdash;never gather a nugget,
never a grain of its dust.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this outburst there was a moment&#8217;s
silence; then Kit Carson spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Moccasin Williams now has the
map,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Have you any idea where
he is?&#8221;</p>

<p>The half-breed leaped up.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had, would I be here?&#8221; asked he,
his eyes aflame. &#8220;Would I not be stepping
in his tracks and hoping for the moment
which would bring me up with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you searched the town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have. To-morrow I go to Taos.
Then the settlements all through the hills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
will be searched. I have friends who will
help me. There&#8217;s not an Indian village
but will come under our eyes, or hide him
from us. And when I find him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here his gesture finished the sentence&mdash;a
gesture as deadly in its meaning as the
coiling of a rattlesnake.</p>

<p>After a few moments more in the storehouse
of Goat Beard, the three Americans
left.</p>

<p>&#8220;The map is gone, sure enough,&#8221; said
Kit, as they went slowly down the street.
&#8220;And that this blackguard Moccasin Williams
has it, is more than likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But is Lopez to escape punishment?&#8221;
asked Dave, who tingled with a desire to
bring the half-breed to book for what he
had done, and the labor, the anxiety, the
peril he had caused them.</p>

<p>Kit shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Santa F&eacute; is only a frontier town,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;And what little law there is is Mexican,
and Mexican law don&#8217;t go very far in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
favor of an American. There are men who&#8217;d
take the thing in their own hands and deal
with Spotted Snake as Spotted Snake says
he&#8217;ll deal with this man Williams if he ever
puts his eyes on him; but we are not that
kind. We&#8217;ll wait; for who knows what will
happen, and maybe before a great while.&#8221;</p>

<p>That evening the three held council; and
it was not long before they came to an
agreement. Joe and Dave each wrote a
long letter telling of what they had done
and what they meant to do. These were
addressed to Joe&#8217;s father at the San Gabriel
Mission. They told him to be of good
heart and to remain where he was until he
heard from them again.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to search for Moccasin
Williams until we find him,&#8221; wrote Joe to
his father. &#8220;And to help us we have the
finest fellow you ever saw&mdash;a dead shot, and
one of the quickest brains on the frontier.
It may be some time before we see you
again; but don&#8217;t worry, dad; we&#8217;ll be all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
right, and will come through it all with
credit to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Buck Morgan&#8217;ll be trading up as far as
the Colorado this summer,&#8221; Kit told the
boys. &#8220;And he&#8217;ll be sure to find a Mexican
or a Pueblo who&#8217;ll carry the writings to the
mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next day this was seen to; the trader,
who was the same Kit had interviewed on
the previous morning, readily agreed to see
to the forwarding of the letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll send a little word of my own,&#8221;
said he kindly to the boys. &#8220;You see
you&#8217;re only youngsters and he might think
you&#8217;re plunging into some harum-scarum
thing that&#8217;ll bring you nothing but danger.
But if an outsider tells him it&#8217;s the best thing
to be done, it might hearten him up a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys thanked Mr. Morgan for his
good-natured offer and begged him not to
let the idea slip his mind; then, with Kit,
they rode off toward Taos.</p>

<p>This latter town was even of a more primitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
cast than Santa F&eacute;; it was smaller and
the population was less law abiding. Into
Taos poured all the trappers, teamsters and
other wild spirits of the country; and from
Taos set out almost all the expeditions in
search of fur, trade and adventure. A week
was given to the search for Moccasin Williams;
but they failed to find him.</p>

<p>They were careful to make but guarded
inquiries for the man; to have him learn,
in case he was skulking anywhere about,
that he was being sought, would have no
other effect than to frighten him away.</p>

<p>However, the search was thorough for all
their secrecy; and the end was that Taos
was given up as a possible hiding place.</p>

<p>Then they took up Lopez&#8217; idea of the settlements
off among the hills; weird barbarous
places where the Mexicans and half-breeds
lived in a most primitive condition;
failing to find any trace of the man the Indians
were tried at their lonely villages;
but all to no purpose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone,&#8221; said Kit, with conviction,
one day at the end of summer; &#8220;he&#8217;s gone
as sure as shooting. But where?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then one day, on the main street of Taos,
they encountered old Zeke Matthews.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just now joined Fitzpatrick&#8217;s company
to trap on the Salmon River,&#8221; he told them,
after they had exchanged greetings. &#8220;Lot
of trapping going to be done this season.
Old Cap&#8217;n Gaunt went out already. Got
some of Young&#8217;s old men; I&#8217;d have gone
too, but you see I&#8217;ve got so&#8217;s I pick my
company very carefully these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trapper and the two boys smiled at
the old fellow&#8217;s manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t like some of Gaunt&#8217;s men,
then?&#8221; said Kit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly. There&#8217;s some right down
scalawags among them,&#8221; said Zeke. &#8220;Good
trappers, mind you. But that ain&#8217;t everything.
I&#8217;ve had too many hard rubs from
the Injuns in my day to join a company
that&#8217;s got a renegade among &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>&#8220;A renegade,&#8221; said Kit, and there was a
quick snap in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moccasin Williams,&#8221; said Zeke.</p>

<p>&#8220;So he&#8217;s gone out with Captain Gaunt&#8217;s
party, has he?&#8221; said Kit. &#8220;And what
country does the captain propose to trap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the Laramie and the Snake Rivers,
I hear,&#8221; replied Zeke. &#8220;About the same
section as Fitzpatrick&#8217;s crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>That evening Kit and his two young
friends held another council.</p>

<p>&#8220;Williams&#8217; going out with Captain Gaunt
shows one thing very plainly,&#8221; said the
trapper. &#8220;Either he&#8217;s heard of us searching
for him, or Spotted Snake&#8217;s been so hot
on his trail that there was nothing else to
do. He didn&#8217;t dare make for California to
prove the truth of the map, because he felt
that somebody would be sure to be watching
for him at the missions or towns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose his plans are?&#8221;
asked Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; said the trapper, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
thoughtfully at them both, &#8220;that he&#8217;s gone
out with Gaunt just to wait till the search
for him dies down. Or it might be that he
means to make for the coast by a longer
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dave thought of the grim mountain
chains, the trackless prairies, the roving
bands of Indians, some of whom had never
seen a white man.</p>

<p>&#8220;A single man could never make his way
by that route,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Kit shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; he said, slowly. &#8220;But, at
the same time, don&#8217;t forget that Moccasin
Williams has lived among the redskins; he
knows their ways and talks their languages.
What would be death to any other might
be smooth going enough for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must reach him before he leaves
the trapping company he went out with,&#8221;
said Joe, excitedly. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t he&#8217;ll
get away from us for good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Kit, thoughtfully, &#8220;we can&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
follow Gaunt&#8217;s track by ourselves. The
Indians would be down on us before we&#8217;d
been out a week. But old Zeke says Fitzpatrick&#8217;s
company is going to trap in much
the same country as Gaunt. What say if
we join Fitzpatrick, and in that way get
within striking distance of our man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Both lads jumped at the idea; and
next morning the three went to see Mr.
Fitzpatrick, a trapper and trader well
known in the southwest. He was pleased
to see them, for men were rather difficult to
secure at the time.</p>

<p>The result was that in an hour all arrangements
were made; and in a few weeks
Kit Carson and his boy comrades had
turned their faces toward the wilderness
once more.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>IN THE COUNTRY OF THE HOSTILES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fitzpatrick</span>, the head of the fur hunting
expedition of which Kit Carson now made
one, was a hardy, courageous man, a good
trapper, and knew the country and its signs
as well as any other man of his time.</p>

<p>He led his party almost north; this course
they held until they reached the head
waters of the Platte.</p>

<p>Winter was now upon them in the midst
of the mountains; the snow filled the
defiles, the icy wind moaned in the naked
trees and among the crags. But besides
their buckskins the trappers now wore thick
furs; and the warm blood of a vigorous life
in the hills and on the prairies made the
experience only one of increased pleasure to
the hardy border men.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>At each camp enough &#8220;half faced&#8221; houses
were erected to shelter the men from the
wind and snow. These were made of
boughs, barks and skins and were of three
sides and a roof. The front was open,
toward the fire; the men slept on fur robes
or blankets, their feet turned to the blazing
logs.</p>

<p>The Platte was followed slowly, the party
taking furs all the way to the Sweet Water,
one of its tributaries; and this stream in
turn was trapped until they reached Green
River. From there they progressed to
Jackson&#8217;s Hole, a fork of the Columbia;
then on to the Salmon River where a part
of their own band, which had left Taos
some days in advance, joined them.</p>

<p>Old Zeke Matthews was among these new
men; and at once Kit and the boys began
questioning him with regard to any news
which he might have heard of Gaunt&#8217;s
men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing at all,&#8221; replied the old fellow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
&#8220;A couple of Injuns came into camp one
night and told us that some trappers were at
work a little west of us; but from what they
said I&#8217;m pretty nigh sure they were Sinclair&#8217;s
party who left about the same time
we did.&#8221;</p>

<p>The entire Fitzpatrick expedition now
having gathered, a group of warm huts was
erected in a sunny valley, protected from
the sweep of the winds; and as the trappers
meant to spend the remainder of the winter
there, they were at more pains to arrange
the camp, and make themselves comfortable.</p>

<p>Most of the time in this long encampment
was spent in dressing pelts and mending
and making equipment and clothing.
The only hunting done was for food. They
were in the country of the Blackfeet, a
daring nation of red marauders, but because
of the cold the trappers did not
expect any troublesome attention from
them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>&#8220;They&#8217;ll stick to their lodges,&#8221; said
Zeke; &#8220;the varmints don&#8217;t like hard
weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>But that they had all reckoned without
the wile of the red man and his desire for
the property of the whites was soon made
evident. A herd of buffalo was sighted
one day on a plain, and a party of four of
the trappers mounted and went in pursuit.
Just how their fate overtook them will
never be known; but that it was sudden
and dreadful was plain to their comrades.
A band of Indians dashed down upon them
and all four lost their lives.</p>

<p>Vengeance shook the camp on the Salmon
River; in a fury the trappers armed; but
for all their swiftness the savages escaped;
not even an eagle plume was seen; and
their tracks were lost in the falling snow.</p>

<p>When the spring opened operations were
commenced on the Salmon; at length they
reached the Snake or Shoshone River; and
the giant falls one day burst upon the vision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
of the boys. The lava peaks rose in wild
grandeur all about it; the mighty rush of
the water awed and amazed even the hardy
spirits of the buckskinned adventurers.</p>

<p>Along the Snake they trapped to the
Bear; and from there to the Green River
once more. Here they encountered a
trapper band which proved to be that of
Sinclair, of whom Zeke had spoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Gaunt,&#8221; said head trapper Sinclair
to Kit. &#8220;Why, yes, I&#8217;ve heard of him
now and then since we got up into this
country. He put in the winter on the
Laramie River; and if I&#8217;m not much mistaken
he&#8217;s now trapping somewhere in the
South Park.&#8221;</p>

<p>At once Kit sought out Mr. Fitzpatrick;
he told the adventurous Irishman as much
as he saw fit of the hunt for Moccasin
Williams and the desire of himself and the
boys to hunt up Gaunt&#8217;s band without
delay, now that it was located.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; said the chief trapper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
&#8220;go, and good luck to you. And it&#8217;s catch
the thief of the world I hope you do. For
the like of him is a bigger danger than the
Blackfeet themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeke Matthews and another seasoned
adventurer named Gordon elected to follow
Kit and his young friends in their journey
to the South Park.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Fitzpatrick company are about
through their trapping,&#8221; said the first of
these veterans, &#8220;and there&#8217;s no use taking
a long ride back to Taos, only to turn about
and make for the rivers again in a little
while after. Gaunt&#8217;s going to stay; he&#8217;ll
cache his pelts until he&#8217;s put in a couple of
seasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the four, well armed, set out; and
without any notable adventures reached the
trapping ground of Captain Gaunt. The
latter was a hearty man past sixty, a true
type of the Westerner of the time. He
welcomed the visitors to his outfit with the
utmost warmth. But when Kit spoke of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
the object of their journey he frowned
blackly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moccasin Williams, do you say?&#8221; he
almost shouted; before he could continue
Kit laid a warning hand upon his
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so loud,&#8221; said the young trapper;
&#8220;he&#8217;ll hear you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if he does, he&#8217;s got mighty good
ears,&#8221; said the downright Captain Gaunt.
&#8220;For he&#8217;s away somewhere in the hills with
the redskins. And stole some of my best
horses when he went.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Dave and Joe felt that the
mountains had toppled over upon them;
they had counted so strongly upon the result
of coming up with this particular trapping
expedition that the shock of disappointment
was harder to bear than it had
been at any other time. Gone! And they
had possibly been within a few days&#8217; journey
of him frequently; if they had known
where Gaunt&#8217;s men were working they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
could have set out for his camp while there
was still hope of success. But now that
was at an end.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got it to do all over again,&#8221; said
Joe in a weary sort of way, for the long
anxiety had told on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; we must begin at the beginning,&#8221;
admitted Dave. &#8220;But,&#8221; and there was a
flash in his eyes, &#8220;we&#8217;ll find him for all
that, and we&#8217;ll find the map too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit and Captain Gaunt were conversing
aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was warned against the fellow,&#8221; said
the head trapper. &#8220;They told me he wasn&#8217;t
to be trusted.&#8221; Then with some curiosity
in his voice, &#8220;Anything particular you
wanted of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A kind of private matter,&#8221; said Kit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some sort of rascality, I&#8217;ll venture to
say,&#8221; was the captain&#8217;s comment.</p>

<p>Then the five wanderers from Fitzpatrick&#8217;s
outfit held council together. Zeke
and the other trapper, as has been noted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
intended to join Gaunt&#8217;s party from their
start for the South Park; and now Kit and
the lads could see nothing but the same
process for themselves. Gaunt was glad
enough to secure them, as he had come out
with fewer men than he intended, so the
routine of camp and trap and rifle was
taken up once more.</p>

<p>They had been with Gaunt&#8217;s men for
some time, ever on the outlook for news of
a white man among the savages of the
region, when one night a band of marauders
crept up to the camp. The guard was
slack, perhaps; but that the night was a
dark one was a certainty. At any rate the
Indians managed to get among the horses
without being detected; and when dawn
came, nine of the very best animals were
missing.</p>

<p>Zeke Matthews made the discovery, and
his whoop startled the camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Injuns,&#8221; stated he, pointing to the
ground, where the &#8220;signs&#8221; were plentiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
enough. &#8220;And they&#8217;ve driv&#8217; off a lot of
the hosses.&#8221;</p>

<p>From some articles of equipment lost by
the savages, it was learned that they were
Crows; and their trail led broad and plain
into the hills. Captain Gaunt surveyed his
men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want a party to take the trail, bring
back the nags and show the thieves that
there&#8217;s a punishment waiting for every one
who doesn&#8217;t respect the law of the wilderness,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Who will go?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit Carson stepped out from among the
men; the boys, who would have followed
him anywhere, did the same; in a moment
there was a party of a dozen saddling
their mustangs and making ready for the
chase.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hold this camp until you return,&#8221;
said Gaunt. &#8220;And bring back the horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Along the trail sped the twelve, Kit Carson
riding silently ahead, his eyes searching
the ground. That the Crows were a rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
numerous party was evident from the hoof-prints
of the ridden horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re ten to one against us,&#8221; said old
Zeke, who was one of the pursuers and
whose experienced eyes also searched the
trail. &#8220;But that ain&#8217;t of no account. A
white man ought to be good for twice that
many redskins, any day!&#8221;</p>

<p>After following the trail something like
five miles it grew greatly confused. During
the night a huge herd of buffalo had
crossed and recrossed it; but the genius of
the wilderness was strong in Kit Carson
even at that early time; in spite of everything
he never failed to pick up the track
each time it was lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;The foot of a horse is different from a
buffalo&#8217;s,&#8221; said he, briefly, in answer to a
question of Dave&#8217;s. &#8220;And if you keep a
sharp eye on the trail, you&#8217;ll see the print
of a horse every now and then, even among
all the buffalo tracks.&#8221;</p>

<p>All day they rode at a good pace; and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
late in the afternoon they had covered some
forty miles. The horses were jaded, and if
they were to be kept fit to continue the
trail the next day they must be rested and
fed.</p>

<p>There was a clump of trees near by their
halting place which seemed an excellent
spot for a camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take a rest here,&#8221; said Kit, &#8220;and
have a snack. The nags can pick up a little
green stuff, too, maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winter had come again, and the horses,
from lack of herbage upon which to feed,
were in poor condition. There was a
promise of soft boughs and young bark in
the grove; the trappers&#8217; animals lived upon
such fodder in the cold months, and the
prospect made them as eager and restive for
the camp as their riders.</p>

<p>They were within a hundred yards of the
timber when a sound caught their ears.
There was a low command from Kit, and
the trappers drew rein instantly. Again the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
sound came to them, a sharp yelp as of an
animal in pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;A dog,&#8221; said Kit; &#8220;and on the other
side of the timber.&#8221;</p>

<p>The presence of a dog in the wilderness is
a positive indication of the presence of man
at no great distance. There was not one of
the seasoned trappers but knew this; and
the minds of Dave and Joe seeing the effect
upon their companion grasped the fact instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Redskins!&#8221; said Kit Carson. &#8220;Look
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Above the tree tops two towering columns
of smoke were ascending; that a camp of
some size existed among or upon the opposite
side of the trees the whites were now
convinced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_137.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;REDSKINS!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This way,&#8221; said Kit, as he turned his
horse. Some little distance back, there was
a rise in the ground; behind this he remembered
to have seen a clump of timber something
like that which had just been the object<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
of their attention. Reaching the trees,
they dismounted; the horses were tied and
then Kit said quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys, we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s ahead of
us; so the best thing is to have a look over
the ground before we make another move.
I&#8217;m going across this bit of prairie and have
a look at that camp over there. It may be
the band we are after, or it may not be. In
an hour you&#8217;ll know. Anyhow, get yourselves
ready for action, for we don&#8217;t know
what may be the outcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>He left them among the trees and advanced
toward the timber from which the
smoke was still ascending. The prairie was
a rolling one; here and there cover was to
be had; and Kit cautiously advanced from
place to place, his woodcraft making him
invisible for the greater part of the time
from the grove ahead.</p>

<p>At length he reached the edge of the
clump; upon his hands and knees he crept
forward, parting the undergrowth and low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
hanging limbs that his body might slip
noiselessly through. Finally he sighted the
camp, and as he did so he settled down
with a quick intake of the breath.</p>

<p>Two large fires were burning; and at
each was roasting a butchered horse. A
company of painted savages, full armed
and with the feathers of their war bonnets
hanging down their backs, were grouped
about. A couple of lodges, strengthened so
as to be used as places of defense in case of
need, were erected at one side; a little distance
away were tethered the horses stolen
from the camp of Captain Gaunt, minus the
two roasting to provide a feast for the Crows.</p>

<p>Usually keen to suspect the proximity of
a foe, the Indians now displayed surprising
laxity. Perhaps the great distance they
had put between themselves and the trappers
was the cause of this; they thought
themselves beyond the reach of pursuit,
and so were giving themselves up to the
enjoyment of their enterprise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>Kit watched them for some time; then
as the shadows began to thicken, he crept
away across the stretch of prairie to the
place where he had left his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the party we are after,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;I saw the horses. The reds are making
preparations for a big feast, and haven&#8217;t
any thought of danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Feasting, eh?&#8221; said old Zeke. &#8220;Well,
boys, it seems to me we ought to have a
little to say in these festivities. Captain
Gaunt reckons on a trifle of powder being
burned by way of protest against horse-stealing
in general, and it&#8217;s as little as we
can do to go according to his will.&#8221;</p>

<p>At nightfall the sound of barbaric song
came across the prairie; and as the trappers
stole toward the Indian camp they saw the
red glow of the fires, and through the trees
the swaying, contorting forms of the warriors
going through a savage dance of
triumph.</p>

<p>The Indians had come from the north<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
with their booty of horse-flesh, and from
the north alone they looked for pursuit;
the trappers knew that this would be the
case, so they took care to approach the
camp from another side. When close enough
to see all that went on at the camp-fires of
the Crows, they crouched down in sheltered
places and waited for the end of the
feast.</p>

<p>It was a cold night, and there was some
snow upon the ground. And as they waited
the whites grew chilled and stiff; their
limbs quaked and their teeth chattered.
But when the braves had finally eaten
their fill and danced themselves tired they
laid themselves down to sleep; and soon a
torpor overtook the camp.</p>

<p>This was the time for which the trappers
had been waiting; Kit, with five others,
slipped away to the place where the horses
were grouped, freed, and drove them away.
Some little distance away the remainder of
the party joined them; then a council in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
low pitched voices was held as to what was
the next step.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got our horses,&#8221; counseled one
of the men. &#8220;The redskins are a pretty
powerful band and we&#8217;re a long way from
support. So it&#8217;s my opinion that we ought
to be satisfied with our good luck and start
back for camp right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>A number of the others agreed to this;
but Kit Carson said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The thieves should be punished.
Another thing, our nags are pretty well
done up and we&#8217;ll have to go slowly. Our
trail will show the Crows that there&#8217;s only
a few of us; and they&#8217;ll pursue us. In a
thing like this there&#8217;s a big chance against
us; so if we can, we had better shift things
around in our favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that to be done?&#8221; asked the
trapper who had favored letting well enough
alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have them now just where an
attack would scare them most. Let us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
throw a volley into their camp and charge
them; they&#8217;ll start running then, and the
chances are we&#8217;ll have nothing more to
fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Them words is words of wisdom!&#8221; declared
Zeke Matthews, slapping the butt of
his rifle emphatically. &#8220;Strike hard now
and we needn&#8217;t be afraid later.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trappers, an adventurous lot by
nature, at once fell in with the idea. They
looked to their weapons carefully; then
with steps trained to softness, they stole
upon the Crow camp.</p>

<p>The fires had been allowed to die somewhat;
the plumed head of a lonely guard
nodded at the edge of the firelight; the
sleeping warriors, laden with food, never
stirred.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a lean dog arose; his ill
shaped head lifted, and he began to sniff,
suspicion in every hair. Then he sprang
forward, barking loudly to arouse his
savage masters. Trained to awake at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
such an alarm, some of the Indians
sprang up; and as they did so the long
rifles of the trappers lifted, and a volley
went whistling into the camp.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>A DESPERATE EXPERIENCE WITH GRIZZLIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the bullets of the trappers sang their
way into the Crow encampment, the warriors
began to fall; the whites stationed
themselves behind trees and reloaded; and
while they were doing so the savages sought
the cover of the two fortified lodges which
they had erected. From this shelter the
arrows began to dart; but the thick tree
trunks protected the trappers from their
barbed heads.</p>

<p>At early dawn the Indians saw how few
in number the whites were; at once they
poured forth, with tomahawk, war club
and scalping knife, to crush them. But
at a discharge of the rifles five of the band
dropped in their tracks; the others fled
into the forts once more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s about all we&#8217;ll hear of
them,&#8221; said old Zeke, as he rammed a fresh
charge of powder home and topped it with
a bullet. &#8220;They ain&#8217;t got the stomachs for
such work as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your places,&#8221; ordered Kit Carson;
&#8220;they will attack again.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very little while proved that he was
right, and Zeke, veteran though he was in
Indian warfare, was wrong. Out of the
strongholds rushed the Crows, and with
yells of fury charged the hunters. So
fierce was their attack that the white men
were forced to fall back; but the deadly
rifles continued to ring through the dawn
and savage after savage fell before them.
Three trappers had been left with the
horses; these, hearing the continuous fire,
now joined their comrades. The additional
rifles were more than the redskins could
stand; completely defeated, they drew off.
The trappers did not wait for them to
ponder the situation, but fell back to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
horses; mounting in haste and leading the
recaptured animals they headed for the
Arkansas River, where the camp of Captain
Gaunt was then located.</p>

<p>For some time longer Kit and the boys
remained with the Gaunt expedition; then,
as nothing seemed to develop in the matter
of Moccasin Williams, and as the fur taking
had grown poor, the three made up their
minds to a desperate venture. This was
nothing less than to leave the company of
trappers and make their way back to Taos.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dangerous journey,&#8221; said Captain
Gaunt; &#8220;but if your minds are made up,
go ahead. You are under no obligations to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>By great good fortune along the whole
of the long route through the wilderness
they did not sight a single Indian. Now
and then they came upon a cold encampment
and other signs of the red man&#8217;s
presence; but never a plume of the warrior
himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>On the way they trapped and had rare
good fortune; when they reached Taos
they had a rich taking of beaver pelts
which just then were in great demand and
consequently high in price. At once their
inquiries were put afoot as to Moccasin
Williams; neither of the lads had ever seen
the man, but Kit Carson&#8217;s description of
him was so complete and they bore it so
thoroughly in mind that they were confident
that they would know him if they
ever met with him.</p>

<p>But the result was the same as before.
Old Diaz, whom they visited, shook his
head and tugged at his goat&#8217;s beard sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never laid eyes on him, se&ntilde;or,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Not once since you were here
last. And not once have I seen Lopez either
since that day. He is away, there,&#8221; one
trembling hand indicating the north,
&#8220;away among the Crows and Blackfeet
searching for the Americano, Williams.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>After a week in Taos, Joe grew restless.
He had heard of an expedition, much like
that of Young&#8217;s, which was to head secretly
for California.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been two years since we saw my
father,&#8221; he said to Dave. &#8220;And it&#8217;s been
almost as long since we wrote to him. Let
us go out with this party; after we see him,
and if he is willing, we will come back and
take up the trail once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing how Joe felt in the matter, Dave
gave a ready consent; they spoke to Kit,
and though the trapper was sorry to lose
them, he saw that this was the right thing
for them to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said he, as he clasped their
hands at parting, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be back just as
you say. And maybe again you won&#8217;t, for
you might find Williams among the missions
up there where you&#8217;re going, looking
for that river of gold that old Goat Beard
talked about. But, however it turns out,
don&#8217;t forget that I&#8217;ve got to care a good bit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
about you two boys; and I&#8217;m only sorry
that I couldn&#8217;t do something for you that&#8217;d
help you to get what you&#8217;re after.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the lads went off on another
journey through mountain, plain and
desert.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Kit joined a fur
hunting expedition sent out by the celebrated
firm of Bent &amp; St. Vrain, under
the leadership of Captain Lee, once of the
United States Army. Later he spent some
time on the Laramie River with old Zeke
Matthews and two other men, the venture
being one of his own. It was returning
with this that Kit met with the most desperate
adventure that he had taken part in
up till that time.</p>

<p>The party had gone into camp one afternoon,
and being short of meat, Kit took his
rifle and started out to look for game. A
mile from camp he came upon elk signs; he
followed their tracks until he came in sight
of them feeding upon a hillside. Craftily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
he advanced upon them; but fine as was his
skill the elk got scent of him, tossed their
antlered heads and broke into a run. Up
went the never failing rifle, and a noble
buck dropped upon the brow of the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lucky shot,&#8221; spoke the trapper, as he
stood with the empty rifle smoking in his
hands, his eyes upon the fallen buck. But
hardly had he spoken the words when he
heard a most terrific series of roars; like
lightning he turned and saw a pair of
enormous grizzly bears, their eyes red with
rage, and their cruel teeth gleaming, charging
down upon him.</p>

<p>There was no time to think out a plan of
defense; the grizzly is an immense brute,
weighing more than a thousand pounds,
and often swift enough to outrun a horse.
So Kit dropped his empty rifle, turned
about and ran.</p>

<p>The great beasts came lumbering after
him, to all appearances awkward and slow,
but in reality with astonishing swiftness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
Kit knew their speed, having had previous
experience with them, though none so desperate
as this; and he knew that in a few
moments, at most, he would be overtaken.</p>

<p>As he ran his eyes went here and there
for a place of safety; then, straight ahead,
he saw a tree, the branches of which were
fairly low. As he came under it, he grasped
a limb and with a mighty pull swung himself
upward, a blow from the foremost
grizzly barely missing him.</p>

<p>The tree had been the only thing the hard-pressed
trapper could think of; and no
sooner had he gotten settled in a branch
than he realized that he was in a sort of
trap. Bears are noted climbers; even the
enormous grizzlies can ascend trees with
ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; muttered Kit, as this came to him,
&#8220;and they&#8217;ll be after me like a couple of
tornadoes in a few minutes. So I&#8217;d better
find something or some way of defending
myself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>He still retained his heavy hunting knife,
but though the blade was broad and keen
he knew that it would be but poor weapon
with which to meet the attack of such brutes
as the two growling and staring up at him
from below.</p>

<p>But still, the knife would be useful, for
all. He drew it from its sheath, and began
cutting furiously at a thick, short branch
which grew at his hand; this was soon
trimmed, and as he balanced the heavy
club which it made, he said with satisfaction:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s something, anyhow! I&#8217;ll not
have to meet them empty handed. So,
come on, my lads, I&#8217;m ready for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bears needed no invitation, however;
they had been measuring the situation from
their places beneath the tree; and one of
them had risen upon his hind legs, dug
his great claws into the trunk and begun to
climb upward.</p>

<p>The foremost part of a bear, in climbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
a tree, is his nose; and the noses of most
animals are very tender and easily hurt.
The grizzly bear&#8217;s is no exception. So as the
climber came within reach, Kit swung his
club; the blow landed fair and true, the
bear yelled with pain, and slipped back to
the ground. But the other stood ready to
take his place; Kit cleared away the small
boughs which might entangle his weapon
and so interfere with his stroke. Once
more the heavy club swished downward,
and again it landed upon an eager, uplifted
snout. There was another roar, and the
second bear slid to the ground. They stood
together, and glared at the trapper, their
roars and shrieks making the lonely mountains
ring. Then, their pain easing somewhat,
they attacked once more. Again and
again the club struck the tender, bleeding
snouts, again and again the bears roared in
agony and fell back.</p>

<p>At length they lost heart in the matter
and sat watching him sullenly and pawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
their noses; but as he made no move to
come down, they finally gave up the vigil
just as the long shadow of night began to
fall; and with many looks over their
shoulders they lumbered away into the
woods.</p>

<p>Kit waited for a space; then he slid down
the trunk of the tree and ran softly and
swiftly toward the spot where he had
dropped his rifle. The piece was still unharmed;
and the trapper reloaded it and
stood listening. From the depths of the
forest came the sound of the bears crushing
through the underbrush; then this died
away in the distance and all was still.</p>

<small>THE BULLY OF THE TRADING CAMP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> making sure that the bears were
not returning, Kit Carson shouldered his
rifle and made his way back to camp through
the gathering dusk. It was dark when he
reached there, and this made it unadvisable
to take a packhorse after the carcass of the
elk; so the trappers had to be content with
rather short commons until the next day,
when their rifles came into play and meat
was had for the larder.</p>

<p>Joined by a trapping party under Bridger,
Kit went to the rendezvous of the Rocky
Mountain trappers on Green River. There
were about two hundred men in this big
camp, which was for the purpose of selling
their furs and buying supplies. The trading
being done, Kit joined a trapping company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
journeying into the Blackfoot country
at the head of the Missouri River. But the
redskins made such determined and persistent
attacks that the party was forced to
retire from their country.</p>

<p>They fell back to the Big Snake River,
where they wintered. But the Blackfeet
still held the trail; in a desperate battle
with this dangerous tribe Kit was seriously
wounded in saving the life of a comrade
named Markhead; in this fight the savages
received a terrible beating.</p>

<p>The spring season was a most fortunate
one; beaver was very plentiful and their
taking of the fur was rich. Kit&#8217;s wound
got well rapidly, thanks to his strong constitution,
and he was soon able to set his
traps with the rest of them.</p>

<p>The long journeys through the wilderness
to Taos and Santa F&eacute; were too great a
strain upon both horses and men; the dangers
of the journey were too grave to be
undertaken several times a year; and so the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
big trading camp on Green River grew very
popular with the trappers. So, the season
being over, the different companies all
headed toward this station; the one which
Kit Carson was with among them.</p>

<p>As the ponies pranced along the long
street of the camp, and the pack animals
moved more soberly under their burden of
furs, the bronzed trappers waved their
coonskin caps and shouted joyously to
friends whom they recognized by the way.
This great fair of the Rocky Mountain
trappers occupied quite a beautiful site;
circling it were the giant hills, crowned
with mighty forests; the huts of the trappers
and traders were built among the trees;
some were after the fashion of Indian
lodges, others were of bark and poles and
sod. But the traders had structures of
hewn logs to hold their stores.</p>

<p>Kit rode through the camp, speaking to
his friends among those who came forward
to greet the newcomers. He was dismounting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
when there came a rush of feet and he
was seized by two pairs of strong arms.
Two enthusiastic voices cried, joyfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are, at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been waiting for you a whole
month!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d come, Kit!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re back again; and we&#8217;ve got
news!&#8221;</p>

<p>The young trapper wriggled out of the
clutch of his assailants; and one look
showed him that they were Dave Johnson
and Joe Frazier.</p>

<p>Gripping their hands in welcome, he
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, lads, this is a surprise, sure
enough! I never expected to see you so
soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We came back with the same party we
went out with,&#8221; said Dave. &#8220;We heard at
Taos that you were out in this region and
that you would probably put in the summer
at this trading camp. So there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
chance with a trader helping with the
packhorses, and we jumped at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you find your father?&#8221; asked
Kit of Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw him looking better,&#8221; replied
the boy. &#8220;But come over to our place;
we&#8217;ve got a shanty big enough for the three
of us. And hurry! We left a pair of
prairie chickens roasting over the fire; and
we&#8217;re to have flap-jacks and coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dave hurried to their hut, which was in a
shaded place on the edge of the camp, to
see to the chickens; Joe and the trapper
followed at a slower pace. The two lads
helped to unsaddle the mustang, and Joe
picketed him where the grass was rich and
thick. Then they all sat down and watched
the fowls brown on the spit and the coffee-pot
send up its jet of steam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father wasn&#8217;t against your leaving
him again, then?&#8221; said Kit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father has gone back home,&#8221; said Joe.
Then seeing the trapper&#8217;s astonishment, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
added: &#8220;You see, while he was at San
Gabriel he learned quite a lot of things.
One of them was that even if we did recover
the map and find the place it indicated,
we&#8217;d hardly be permitted to wash the
gold. The Mexican government and population
are afraid that the Americans will
some day overrun California; and so they
do everything they can to discourage them,
hoping to keep them away. So father
thought there was no use remaining and
neglecting his business at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how does it come that you two
were left behind?&#8221; asked Kit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; laughed Dave, &#8220;we objected to
going back so strongly and made such a
general fuss that uncle made up his mind
that he&#8217;d let us have another try. He took
an American ship which sailed from San
Francisco and will land him in New York.
If we have no success, we are to follow next
season.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Kit. There was a pause,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
then he asked: &#8220;But the news you spoke
of? What is it? Did you find something
out, among the missions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a word,&#8221; said Dave, &#8220;and we spent
a couple of months prowling around among
them. But,&#8221; and here he lowered his
voice, &#8220;on our way here with the trading
party we stumbled upon something&mdash;as
real a piece of news as you could wish
for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Kit, his gray eyes snapping,
&#8220;and what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a French Canadian named
Shunan with the train, a big man, very
quarrelsome and ready with his weapons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know him,&#8221; nodded Kit. &#8220;He&#8217;s a
trapper, and,&#8221; in a puzzled tone, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
see what he was doing with the traders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was making for this fair,&#8221; said Joe.
&#8220;He had been to the settlements on a sort
of mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A mission!&#8221; said Kit.</p>

<p>Both boys nodded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;He&#8217;s quite loose with his tongue,&#8221; said
Dave, &#8220;and we got the whole thing, bit by
bit, at night by the fire. He&#8217;d talk to the
men, you see, boasting of what he&#8217;s done
and meant to do. He&#8217;d been sent in to
Santa F&eacute; to look about and ask questions.
The person who sent him was away in the
Blackfoot country, afraid to venture into
civilization himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly Kit Carson&#8217;s quick mind
grasped the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moccasin Williams!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right! And the person he was inquiring
about was Lopez, the half-breed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Asking if he was in Santa F&eacute;, or in the
region round about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and he found, as we did, that the
half-breed was away north, also in the
Blackfoot country. This seemed to amuse
him. Williams feared to go back to Taos
or Santa F&eacute;; he feared to go to California;
for there he might meet Lopez.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;According to what the Frenchman said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
Williams is in mortal dread of the knife of
the man he robbed,&#8221; said Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;And instead of being safe in the place
he selected for hiding, he is really in great
danger, with Lopez searching for him, as
Shunan heard, from one Indian village to
another. It would have been much better
if he had returned, or had gone to California.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much better for him, perhaps,&#8221; said
Kit, grimly. Then his expression changed
and he added: &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s good news
enough, lads; and we&#8217;ll see what can be
done with it. The map is still in the
hands of Williams; if it were not he&#8217;d not
be so anxious to get to California. And so,
if nothing else, it shows us that we still
have him to look for. You were in luck
to meet this man, Shunan.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the trapper noted the faces of the
boys change in expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t just know about that,&#8221; said
Dave.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>&#8220;We were lucky, in a way,&#8221; admitted
Joe; &#8220;but in another way we were not so
much so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s happened,&#8221; said Kit.</p>

<p>Dave and Joe nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somehow,&#8221; said the former, &#8220;Shunan
got to know of our interest in what he said
in his boasting. It may be that he had
heard of us, and, now that we&#8217;d got his
attention, he&#8217;d placed us for the first time.
Ever since then he&#8217;s been trying to get up
some sort of a quarrel with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Kit Carson.</p>

<p>He sat looking at the boys steadfastly;
and they saw a dangerous, narrowing light
in his gray eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know Shunan,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known
him for some time; and as you said when
you first mentioned him, he&#8217;s quarrelsome
and ready with his weapons. For him to
try and pick a fight with a man means only
one thing&mdash;and that&#8217;s a deadly one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prairie chickens were done, the flap-jacks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
nicely browned and the coffee piping
hot when old Zeke Matthews came along.
Immediately the boys sprang up and
greeted him; he was invited to join them
and did so with alacrity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Roasted birds we get out in the trapping
country,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But flap-jacks
seldom, coffee seldomer, and coffee with
reg&#8217;lar sugar in it, never at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as Zeke ate of these delicacies, Kit
told him of Shunan&#8217;s desire to quarrel with
the boys, though he did not mention the
reason for it. The veteran was indignant.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; demanded he. &#8220;Can&#8217;t he find
no one but a passel of youngsters to fight
with. Well, all I got to say is, let him
look out for himself!&#8221;</p>

<p>Released from the restraint of the wilderness
where they were ever on the lookout
for attacks of savage beasts or savage men,
the trappers relaxed; the trading camp was
a hubbub of sounds. Songs, the squeak of
a fiddle, blustering talk and high pitched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
contention grew constant as each night
passed and the day began.</p>

<p>During one afternoon there was a turmoil
at one end of the camp, a clash of fists
and the sight of bloody faces. Later there
was still another outbreak of the same sort.
Then little by little the thing increased until
the camp roared steadily with strife.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all Shunan,&#8221; said a trader to old
Zeke. &#8220;Fellows like that make more
trouble than a tribe of thieving Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once or twice during the day Kit Carson
caught sight of Shunan. He was a burly
fellow with the air of a bravo; his face was
flushed and his eyes gleamed with menace.</p>

<p>&#8220;A wolf,&#8221; said Kit to the boys. &#8220;So, to
avoid trouble and keep the peace, lay low.
If you can avoid it, don&#8217;t let him see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Dave Johnson and Joe Frazier were
naturally boys of spirit; and their two years
in the wilderness with the trappers had
given them a confidence in themselves
which they might not have had otherwise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
So the idea of concealment, of practically
hiding from a bully, was galling to them.</p>

<p>Kit saw this and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your keeping out of his way won&#8217;t be a
mark against you boys. Nobody&#8217;ll think
the worse of you for it, for more seasoned
men than either of you will be for many
years are dodging this man just now. So
take my advice. Lay low. I don&#8217;t think
it will make any real difference in the end,&#8221;
as an afterthought, &#8220;for if he wants to
force trouble on you, he will. But, when
the time comes, you&#8217;ll have the satisfaction
of knowing that it&#8217;s not your fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads acted upon this suggestion; and
the result was that some time went by without
the bully encountering them. But his
purpose was plain enough; frequently he
came to that part of the camp where the
boys&#8217; hut was located, and his remarks when
any one happened to be in the vicinity
were brutal and offensive. Kit Carson,
Zeke Matthews and some others had erected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
lodges near that of the lads; and they frequently
listened to the bully&#8217;s boasts and
threats and insults without a sign.</p>

<p>But finally the thing grew unbearable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Human nature,&#8221; said the veteran, Zeke,
&#8220;can&#8217;t stand no more. He&#8217;s getting worse.
He thinks we&#8217;re afraid of him. Let him
talk like that just once more, and my rifle&#8217;ll
answer him.&#8221;</p>

<p>At length the day came which brought
the climax. The bully had kept the camp
in hot water all morning; he had engaged
in a half dozen fights with men weaker than
himself, and beaten them; and so he came,
roaring like a mountain bear, toward the
spot where Kit sat with his friends. As it
happened the two lads were in the party.
Both looked up at the Frenchman from
where they lay stretched upon the ground;
and neither made an attempt to avoid him.</p>

<p>He had grown accustomed to their dodging
him; and now that they failed to move
it seemed to inflame him more than ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a camp full of coyotes,&#8221; announced
he, squaring himself before them all.
&#8220;Every one runs when a man comes along.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an ominous silence on the part
of the trappers; and he proceeded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear me speak?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;Did you hear me mention coyotes?
Where&#8217;s the Indian fighters that I&#8217;ve heard
about? Where are they? Did they ever
fight a white man? Well, here&#8217;s their
chance, if they&#8217;ve got the stomachs to take
it up. Here&#8217;s a man that&#8217;s willing to give
them a chance to make a reputation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The silence of the group was still unbroken
and the bully&#8217;s sneering look ran
around the circle.</p>

<p>&#8220;All Americans, eh? Every one an American!
Well, I&#8217;ve beaten all the Frenchmen
in the camp; and as for the Americans,
I&#8217;ll cut a stick some day and switch
them around their own lodges.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again his sneering glance went over
them; then he shrugged his huge shoulders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
contemptuously, turned and started away.
But he had gone hardly half a dozen steps
when a voice called sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shunan!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man halted and wheeled. Kit
Carson stood facing him. The difference in
the two was very great. The Frenchman
was a Hercules; a towering man, with a
great chest and massive limbs; the American
trapper was small and quiet in manner
and seemed in no way a match for him.</p>

<p>But Kit Carson was never a man to stand
back because the odds were not in his favor;
so he advanced toward the camp bully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shunan,&#8221; said he, coolly, his gray eyes
fixed steadfastly upon the man before him,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve all listened to you talk for some
time; and we&#8217;ve said nothing. There are
twenty men in this camp who could beat you
in any kind of fighting you could name.
But they are not trouble seekers; and so
they&#8217;ve stood back. Now, I consider myself
the least among them; and being such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
I take it on myself to say that we are all
tired of you and your bullying. And, further,
I want to say that you will, from this
time on, stop your threats, or I&#8217;ll shoot you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the Frenchman stood staring
at the speaker, his eyes glowing with
fury; then he turned again without a word
toward his own quarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone for his gun,&#8221; said old Zeke.
&#8220;And from his looks he means business.&#8221;</p>

<p>The group of trappers broke up immediately;
sharp action was in the air, and to
meet this their experience told them to be
prepared. But, seeing, from their faces,
what they meant to do, Kit shook his head
negatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my affair, boys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So
I must ask you all to stand aside while I
go through with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s got friends in camp,&#8221; protested
old Zeke. &#8220;They&#8217;ll all be out to see him
through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they interfere,&#8221; said Kit, &#8220;then I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
rely on you to see me through. But I don&#8217;t
think they will. Shunan has had the run
of this camp too long to think he needs
help in a little matter like this. It&#8217;ll be a
matter of pride with him; and you&#8217;ll see,
he&#8217;ll handle it alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like lightning the news of the impending
conflict ran through the camp. The
trappers and traders carefully drew out of
what they thought would be the line of fire,
or placed themselves behind trees or the
heavy log houses.</p>

<p>The boys went after Kit and found him
tightening his saddle-girth, a little distance
from his lodge.</p>

<p>&#8220;By all rights,&#8221; said Dave Johnson,
&#8220;this fight should be mine or Joe&#8217;s. We
brought the man down this way; he was
always looking for us when he came. And
now that trouble has come of it, I don&#8217;t see
why you should shoulder it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit slapped him on the back and
laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>&#8220;The whole thing is a public one,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;The man has come to be a nuisance
and a danger, and so a stop of some sort
must be put to him. We have no law in
the wilderness, nor law officers. But we
know what we want, and somebody always
comes forward to put a thing right. In
this case it is Kit Carson.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having saddled his pony to his satisfaction,
he took out a heavy dragoon pistol
and looked at its priming with much care.
This he placed in his belt, then swung himself
into the saddle. And as Kit rode out
from the line of the lodges, the sound of
hoofs came to him. His quick eye turned
in the direction of the sound; and he saw
the Frenchman mounted on a powerful
horse, a rifle in his hands, riding toward
him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>LOPEZ RIDES INTO CAMP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is written boldly in the records of the
great west that Kit Carson was a man without
fear; and never before did he show this
fact as he did when he turned his horse&#8217;s
head and rode toward the Frenchman,
Shunan. His pony went at a slow, swinging
lope; Kit sat him as quietly as though
he were on his way to try a shot at a flock
of prairie chickens, and there was no enemy
on that side of the range.</p>

<p>And the bully was in no way backward.
But his bluster was gone; all the cunning
in his nature was called upon to aid him in
the crisis. His horse advanced at a swift
pace; and the heads of the two steeds
almost touched when their riders drew
rein.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>&#8220;Shunan,&#8221; said Kit, &#8220;am I the man
you&#8217;re looking for?&#8221;</p>

<p>The eyes of the bully shifted under the
steady gaze of the American.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Then almost instantly the muzzle of his
rifle lifted and covered Kit. But quick as
was his action, Kit&#8217;s was quicker. The
dragoon pistol flashed, and its heavy bullet
struck Shunan in the arm, shattering the
bone; the man&#8217;s weapon exploded a second
after the trapper&#8217;s; and its missile grazed
Kit&#8217;s scalp; then it fell to the ground, and
the man&#8217;s horse, unchecked, turned and
dashed away.</p>

<p>Calmly Kit rode back to where he had
left his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;He meant to kill you,&#8221; stated old Zeke.
&#8220;I saw the way he threw up his rifle barrel
that nothing else would please him.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that the American trapper, lightning
quick and of deadly aim, only shot to disable
his foe was evident to all; had he so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
desired, Shunan would have dropped from
his saddle never to rise again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace in camp is all we want,&#8221; said
Kit, quietly. &#8220;And I think as far as
Shunan&#8217;s concerned we&#8217;ll have it in the
future.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no expedition going that fall
into the Blackfoot country; but one was
organizing for a trading trip in that
direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll join that,&#8221; said Kit.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;we&#8217;ll be taking you
away from work that will be profitable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This matter of the map has me on my
mettle,&#8221; said Kit. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to see it
through now, no matter how long it takes.&#8221;</p>

<p>They accordingly went out with the
traders as far as the Big Snake River. Here
they met a Hudson Bay trader named
McCoy who had about abandoned his operations
because of ill luck, and was about to
take up a trapping venture. They joined
him, thinking to get finally into the region<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
they desired. But after a series of adventures,
one of which saw them on the verge of
starvation in a journey to Fort Hall, they
were forced back to the Green River once
more to await another season.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the last try,&#8221; said Dave, soberly.
&#8220;If we don&#8217;t get up into that country this
time we&#8217;ll have to give it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I promised dad in the letter
I sent off to him yesterday,&#8221; said Joe.
&#8220;One more attempt; and if we fail, we go
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the fall grew near there was much
talk of expeditions into the far regions;
the near-by streams had been trapped so
long that the beaver had become very
scarce; and if success were desired the
hunters must seek new waters.</p>

<p>And in the midst of this, Kit one evening
came to the lodge which the boys had
erected. There was a gleam in his eye
which told them that something of a pleasing
sort had happened.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it looks at last as
though we were going to have a chance.
An expedition, one hundred strong, is to go
as far as the Yellowstone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do we go with them?&#8221; asked
Dave, leaping up in his excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;We do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both boys swung their caps in the air
and leaped about in a series of acrobatic
antics. But Kit sobered them in a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not only do we go,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but
Shunan goes also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Dave; and he sat down in
the door of the lodge.</p>

<p>&#8220;That means something, I should say,&#8221;
said Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;All last season he was laid up with a
maimed arm,&#8221; said Kit; &#8220;and now, as soon
as he&#8217;s able, he engages for the Blackfoot
region. I know he&#8217;s specially set on going
there, because he refused a number of offers
to go out with parties who are to head in
other directions.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>Shunan was a very much changed man;
his manner was subdued, and he gave little
or no trouble to the camp. Kit Carson he
treated with much respect, and the boys he
was careful not to molest. One day, however,
shortly before the big expedition was
to start, he met them in the camp street.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear you&#8217;re going up north,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;We thought it might
be a useful trip&mdash;and maybe profitable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shunan looked at them with something
like his old ferocity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take my advice and go somewhere
else,&#8221; said he, slowly. &#8220;It will be a dangerous
journey for people looking for anything
but beaver fur.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was about to pass on, but Dave Johnson
placed himself in his path.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I say,&#8221; replied the man.
&#8220;Nothing more and nothing less.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he passed on, never giving them
another glance; and when the boys found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
themselves at their lodge that night with
Kit Carson, they mentioned the matter.
The trapper seemed pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that that proves
he&#8217;s going to carry news to his friend,
Moccasin Williams. Anyway, it shows
that he expects to meet him, and doesn&#8217;t
want any one in the party who has a
knowledge of his errand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief trapper of the big expedition
into the Blackfoot country was named
Fontenelle; he was an experienced woodsman,
and of a very determined character.
With the packhorses loaded and the trappers
mounted upon their mustangs, he addressed
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every time we&#8217;ve gone into the region
round about the head waters of the Missouri,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;we&#8217;ve been attacked, our
horses have been stolen, our traps taken,
our men killed; and in almost every case
it has ended in our being driven out.&#8221;</p>

<p>A murmur went up from the men. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
Blackfeet were a hardy and warlike people
who claimed a vast extent of country as
their hunting ground. The tribe was at
that time some thirty thousand strong and
counted the finest of the many races of
American Indians. As hunters they were
unexcelled; their marksmanship was
deadly; and as riders and horse breakers
they were only led by the Comanches.</p>

<p>&#8220;This time they&#8217;ll not drive us back,&#8221;
said old Zeke Matthews, who had engaged
to go out with Fontenelle. He slapped
the stock of his long rifle as he spoke.
&#8220;It&#8217;s our turn now; and we&#8217;ll make the
red thieves run.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is doubtful if any such band of trappers
ever left the Green River before; they
were hardy, seasoned mountaineers, inured
to the wild life of the Rockies, expert in
the craft of beaver taking, and accomplished
in Indian warfare.</p>

<p>Straight on they pushed through the
wilderness, day after day. In the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
of the Crows they met with friendly greetings;
perhaps it was the unusual size of the
party, and perhaps it was because it was
headed for the hunting grounds of the
Blackfeet&mdash;for years the deadly foes of the
Crows. On the Yellowstone, which was
in the heart of the Blackfoot region, they
set about the serious business of taking
fur. The company was divided&mdash;fifty men
to attend the traps and fifty to guard the
camp. The men lived with their rifles in
their hands. As Zeke Matthews put it:</p>

<p>&#8220;The cook turns the meat on the spit
with one hand and has a loaded pistol in
the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fontenelle was constantly urging the men
not to relax.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can hold our own with them,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;But we must not let them surprise
us. Keep your eyes peeled; don&#8217;t overlook
a sign.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit Carson and his two boy friends
needed no urging. And they not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
watched for Blackfeet; they kept an eye
upon the movements of Shunan as well.
However, it was impossible to watch the
man at all times; now and then he&#8217;d be
out of their sight for hours at a time.</p>

<p>One night after supper Kit drew the boys
aside. From beneath his hunting shirt he
drew a small, pointed stick, notched here
and there in a peculiar manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Dave.</p>

<p>&#8220;As we left the last line of traps this
afternoon,&#8221; said Kit, &#8220;I saw Shunan lag
behind and then drop back among some
trees. There were six of us; but I said
nothing to the others. A little later, after
Shunan rejoined us, I made believe I&#8217;d
sighted a small buck and started off, away
from the river. When I got out of sight,
I changed my course, heading back toward
the place where I&#8217;d seen Shunan disappear.
Hunting around, I saw Indian signs in
plenty; and then I saw this,&#8221; holding up
the wand, &#8220;sticking in the ground.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>&#8220;A message!&#8221; said both boys in a breath.</p>

<p>Kit nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and I&#8217;ll venture there was one
waiting for him from Williams or the redskins.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this they kept a stricter watch than
ever upon the Frenchman; but he seemed
to be entirely interested in the work of
trapping and curing furs, and not once did
they detect him in any further communication
with the savages.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve come to some kind of an
understanding,&#8221; said Kit, after a time.
&#8220;And he&#8217;s waiting for a certain time to
come around. Like as not it&#8217;s the spring;
for it&#8217;s too late to jump out now and try to
get back to Santa F&eacute;. Winter&#8217;d overtake
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winter came on at last, the streams were
frozen and the trappers gave up their labors.
They left the Blackfoot country determining
to winter in a more friendly section.
A band of Crows guided them to a sheltered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
valley, and the two parties camped
side by side during the severe months.</p>

<p>The Crows were mostly young warriors,
and splendidly athletic; in good weather
they arrayed themselves against the white
men in games of strength and skill; hunting
was the favorite test, but horsemanship,
running and leaping, were also well liked.
In these contests the boys grew very intimate
with a stalwart young brave whose
name was Tall Thunder.</p>

<p>One night they sat beside him at a lodge
fire in the Crow camp; a number of the
young warriors were also present, but they
rarely spoke, knowing little of the white
man&#8217;s language. Tall Thunder, however,
could make himself understood without
much difficulty. He related many of his
hunting exploits, and some of the deeds of
his tribe in their wars with the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your English is good,&#8221; praised Joe.
&#8220;How did you learn it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um&mdash;much teach!&#8221; explained Tall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
Thunder. &#8220;Half-breed speak much Englees.
Him Spotted Snake.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other. Here
was verification of the story of old Diaz,
the trader at Santa F&eacute;, and of the news
gathered by Shunan. Lopez, or Spotted
Snake, was, or had been, in the northern
wilderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know where Spotted Snake is
now?&#8221; asked Dave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Um! Crow village&mdash;four suns. Live
like chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys understood from this that
Lopez was then in a Crow village four days&#8217;
journey from where they were; and also
that he was much honored. They were
discussing this fact in some excitement,
when the young Crow, who could make
nothing of the rapid English, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Spotted Snake is your friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dave Johnson shook his head. Tall
Thunder seemed to turn the denial over for
a space; then he said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>&#8220;Um! Spotted Snake keep away from
white men. Only want to see one.&#8221; He
nodded his head. &#8220;Him with Blackfeet.
Much hate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hates the white man who lives
among the Blackfeet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tall Thunder nodded once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much hate!&#8221; he repeated. Then as
though to show the extent of the man&#8217;s
hatred: &#8220;Want Crow to go on war-path.
Against Blackfeet. Chiefs and old men
hold council. Say no.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later in the evening the boys spoke to
Kit about this. He was interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lopez has his enemy placed,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;And maybe, through the news brought by
Shunan, Williams knows something about
the whereabouts of Lopez.&#8221; Then, after a
moment, during which he stared into the
fire: &#8220;It seems to me, boys, that your long
hunt is going to come to something at last.
Unless an accident happens Williams will
get out of this region in the spring; Shunan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
will go with him. Watch Shunan; don&#8217;t
let him make a move that we don&#8217;t see, and
we can overreach them.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a hard winter on the horses; soft
branches and bark, the inside layer of the
cottonwood, was the only fodder the poor
animals had for weeks; but the fresh green
of the spring soon began to put them in
condition when that anxiously looked for
season arrived.</p>

<p>While waiting for the horses to pick up
some flesh, Fontenelle, the chief trapper, sent
two men to Fort Laramie for some much
needed supplies. The news came later that
they had been ambushed and killed by
Blackfeet.</p>

<p>It was in no very soft mood that the
trappers set out for their hunting grounds;
but, though they did not know it, the time
for the striking of a retaliatory blow was at
hand.</p>

<p>As they drew near to the source of the
Missouri, they one evening camped on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
fork of a small tributary. The setting sun
was slanting across the stream, the camp-fires
were lighted and the trappers were
cooking their supper, standing guard or
caring for the horses. Suddenly a shout
came from one of the pickets, together with
the sound of hoof-beats. In a few moments
a couple of fur hunters came into camp with
a horseman. In spite of the Indian trappings
worn by both mustang and rider, both
Dave Johnson and Joe Frazier recognized
him at a glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lopez!&#8221; they exclaimed in a breath;
and then the trappers closed in around the
half-breed.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>THE VILLAGE OF THE BLACKFEET</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> throng of buckskin-clad trappers
crowded about the half-breed Lopez; every
eye was on him; all were curious to hear
the nature of his errand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to warn you,&#8221; he said in Spanish,
to Fontenelle. &#8220;Directly in your path, one
day&#8217;s ride from here, is the main village of
the Blackfeet. Hold to your present course
and you&#8217;ll have them swarming around you
like bees.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment there was a dead silence.
Then the many grievances they held against
that particular tribe, and more especially
the fate of the two messengers to Fort
Laramie, came to the minds of the trappers.
As one man they gripped their rifles
and there arose a cry for vengeance. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
half-breed sat his mustang quietly; he
said nothing, but in his eye was a satisfied
gleam. Kit Carson touched Dave
Johnson&#8217;s sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moccasin Williams is in that village.
That is why the half-breed is here. Failing
to get the Crows to attack them, he
now tries our men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And with what result, do you think?&#8221;
asked Dave.</p>

<p>For answer Kit pointed to the trapper
band; to a man, almost, they were gathered
about Fontenelle; their voices were lifted in
a harsh hubbub; their rifles were waved
about; they clamored for war.</p>

<p>It was a wild scene, and one neither of
the boys ever forgot; the rough, bearded
men, buckskin-clad, their weapons gleaming
in the flare of the camp-fires, while all
around was silence and the darkness of the
wilderness.</p>

<p>When the clamor died down, the chief
trapper spoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>&#8220;We have suffered at the hands of the
Blackfeet,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And now that a
chance has come to strike a blow, we will
not let it pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a wild hurrah, and the men
scattered about the camp, gathering at the
various fires, cleaning their rifles, oiling the
locks of their pistols, seeing to the edge of
knife and hatchet.</p>

<p>&#8220;And see that there&#8217;s plenty of good
black powder in your horns,&#8221; advised old
Zeke. &#8220;Bullets and flints will be things
you can&#8217;t have too much of either; for unless
I&#8217;m much mistaken we&#8217;ve got a day of
days ahead of us to-morrow, lads.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the half-breed slipped from his horse
and approached a fire at which Kit and the
boys stood alone he nodded as though not
at all surprised to see them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw all three of you a dozen times
during the winter,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But you
did not see me. I often rode through the
passes when the snow melted, and looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
down at your camp in the valley from the
hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it was then, I guess, that you
thought how well it would fit in with your
plans if you could get our party to attack
the Blackfeet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The half-breed smiled the disagreeable
smile natural to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I never hoped to have it
happen, until the two riders going to Laramie
were killed. After that,&#8221; and he
snapped his fingers, &#8220;I knew it would be
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were so anxious to revenge yourself
on Williams, why have you waited so
long?&#8221; asked Kit. &#8220;A man who really
wanted satisfaction would have tried for it
single-handed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I have not?&#8221; asked
Lopez, quietly. &#8220;Do you suppose I have
been lying by all this time waiting to be
helped? I spent months in trying to find
out where he was. Twice I was taken by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
the Blackfeet and once almost lost my life.
That I could speak their language and
claimed to be related to their tribe was all
that saved me. At last I located him in
the village which you will see to-morrow.
The Pueblos call me Spotted Snake,&#8221; and
he laughed, harshly. &#8220;Well, I tried to
earn the name in my lookout for Moccasin
Williams; for never a snake held so close
to the ground, or crawled so silently
through the grass as I did. But I never got
him as I wanted him. A hundred times I
had him under my rifle, but he was never
near enough for me to be sure. To-morrow,&#8221;
and there was a deadly meaning in
his voice, &#8220;I will try again; and I think I
shall succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fire at which they stood was one removed
from the others, having been kindled
by a horse guard to roast a particularly
prized piece of buffalo tongue while he was
on watch. The trees threw huge, dancing
shadows all about; and their own movements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
were grotesquely mimicked by the
giant shades flung from them by the changing
light. There was a silence after the
half-breed&#8217;s last words; then, as he stood
staring into the red of the blaze, Dave
Johnson fancied he heard a sound behind
him. Trained, by this time, to respond to
sounds which he did not understand, Dave
was about to turn; but he felt the grip of
Kit upon his arm&mdash;a grip which asked for
silence as plainly as words could have
done.</p>

<p>Kit, facing the half-breed, spoke quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;The map which belongs to these boys,
now? What about that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The half-breed gave a gesture of contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can find the man who stole it from
me, that&#8217;s all I ask,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all right,&#8221; said Kit. Then he
added, drily, &#8220;But seeing that you stole it
yourself, Spotted Snake, I think you&#8217;re
making a mighty big complaint.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>&#8220;He claimed to be my friend. He is a
traitor,&#8221; said the half-breed, sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I have said, all right,&#8221; repeated Kit.
&#8220;You can look at the thing just as you
see fit, and I&#8217;ll not say a word against it.
But,&#8221; and here there was a ring in his
voice like that of steel, &#8220;the map belongs
to these two lads, and I&#8217;m going to see that
they get it. It belongs to them and no one
else shall have it; neither you, Lopez, who
stand there grinning at me; nor you, Moccasin
Williams, away there in the Blackfoot
town; nor you, Shunan, who are behind me
in the bushes!&#8221; He wheeled as he spoke
these last words, and faced the darkness.
&#8220;Come out,&#8221; said he. &#8220;We know you&#8217;re
there, and we know why you&#8217;re there.&#8221;</p>

<p>There came a swishing and clattering
among the thick growth, and the burly
Frenchman made his appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was looking for fuel,&#8221; he growled,
sullenly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit regarded him steadily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>&#8220;I never told the rest of the men how
you were in communication with the Blackfeet
in the fall,&#8221; said he. Then as the man
tried to interrupt, he lifted a hand for silence.
&#8220;If I had,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I guess
you know what would have happened&mdash;for
they don&#8217;t love that people. But,&#8221; and the
ring in his voice was as hard as before and
the menace was as clear, &#8220;if you make an
attempt to leave camp to give warning they
will be told now. So, if you value a whole
skin, you&#8217;ll sit tight and say nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never meant to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began the
bully, but Kit stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes no difference what you meant,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The thing is there, just the same.
I&#8217;ll give Fontenelle a hint, and there will
be a quiet guard over you until our little
business with the redskins is done. So mind
what movements you make when away
from the camp. You&#8217;ll not know which
one&#8217;ll draw the bullet from some pistol.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that there was something behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
this warning was soon made plain to the
bully; as he sat by the fire, as he rolled in
his blanket, he felt the watch held over
him; not once during the long night did it
relax; and though he desired ever so much
to warn his confederate among the Indians,
he did not dare to make a move.</p>

<p>Long before dawn the camp was astir,
breakfast was cooked and eaten, and the
entire party of one hundred trappers, under
the guidance of Lopez, started in the direction
of the Blackfoot village. After a
march of some six hours they struck a broad
and well-defined trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;This leads straight to the village,&#8221; said
Lopez. &#8220;Two or three hours more and we
are there.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at this point Fontenelle halted the
column of trappers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be best,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if
a small party went ahead and reconnoitered.
In marching on blindly this way
there is always danger of a trap.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>Lopez protested loudly; but the trappers
as a body thought well of the suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carson,&#8221; said the head trapper to Kit,
&#8220;take five men and go have a look at the
trail and the village. We&#8217;ll camp here until
you return.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly, with Zeke Matthews, the
two boys and a pair of seasoned woodsmen,
Kit started off. Silently they rode along
the narrow Indian trail, being careful to
make a note of every spot that would afford
a chance for an ambuscade; at length they
drew near the village, a perfect city of
lodges; creeping among the rocks and
trees they managed to get a close view of
what was going on.</p>

<p>From the opposite side of the town a great
drove of horses was being driven in; camp
equipment was being brought together as
though for a move.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re none too soon,&#8221; said Kit in a
whisper, to Dave. &#8220;By this time to-morrow
they&#8217;d be gone.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>&#8220;Look!&#8221; said Joe, in a low voice, his
rifle barrel indicating a place near to the
end of a row of lodges. &#8220;A white man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moccasin Williams,&#8221; were Kit&#8217;s words,
as his eyes rested upon the renegade.
&#8220;Well, Spotted Snake was right, wasn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>

<small>THE LAST BATTLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Making</span> sure that the savages were
merely in the first stages of their preparations
for departure, Kit and his little
party of scouts crept away through the
trees and grass to the place where they
had left their horses. Mounting, they
gained the trappers&#8217; camp just after nightfall.</p>

<p>When the news was broken, the woodsmen
gathered about their fires in council.
After some discussion a plan was agreed
upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kit will take half of you,&#8221; said the
chief trapper, &#8220;and ride to the attack.
The other half will stay behind with me
to guard the pack animals and the furs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t stand still,&#8221; was Kit Carson&#8217;s
advice. &#8220;Advance slowly in our track.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
Then you&#8217;ll be a kind of reserve in case
we need you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everything agreed upon, the trappers
rolled themselves in their robes and blankets
around the fires; and at dawn next day
they divided according to their plan; Kit
and his fifty taking the Indian trail at a
swinging pace, every man in the advance
eager for the fight.</p>

<p>&#8220;After to-day,&#8221; prophesied Zeke Matthews,
&#8220;those varmints of Blackfeet won&#8217;t
be so quick with their monkey shines.
They&#8217;ll get a lesson they&#8217;ll remember for
some time to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>They approached the Indian town without
being discovered; the savages were in
the heart of their own country, never
dreaming of attack, and therefore had out
no sentinels. The trappers, each well
mounted, rifle in hand and side arms
ready to be grasped at a second&#8217;s notice,
drew up in a line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, men,&#8221; said Kit, his eyes running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
over them, to make sure that all were prepared.
&#8220;At full speed! Charge!&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a thunderbolt the woodsmen struck
the Blackfoot village; a volley from the
long rifles swept among the warriors and
a dozen of them pitched headlong. A
shrill yell arose; the savages gripped their
weapons and fell back from their town,
fighting every step of the way.</p>

<p>The Blackfoot was a fighting man of
craft, courage and generalship. Unlike the
Crows and more southern tribes, he did not
go mad with excitement when he faced the
superior weapons of the white man. On
the contrary he always fought them according
to a carefully laid out plan.</p>

<p>From behind rocks and stumps and
fallen trees the long arrows began to wing
their deadly way; taking the cue the trappers
protected themselves in much the
same fashion, and their rifles continued to
speed bullets wherever a tufted head showed
itself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>For fully three hours this sort of warfare
continued; the Blackfeet fought with courage
and judgment; craftily they drew the
fire of the trappers until the supply of
ammunition began to grow low.</p>

<p>As this latter grew apparent to Kit he
passed the word to slacken the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t press a trigger unless you are
sure of a redskin,&#8221; was his command.</p>

<p>And as the rifle fire slacked the Indians
grew more bold. They understood what
had happened, and crept forward from tree
to tree, from rock to rock, meaning to get
near enough for a grand rush and then to
engage the whites hand to hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I notice,&#8221; said Dave Johnson, as he lay
at full length behind a stump, his rifle
advanced, his eyes on the dark-skinned
enemy, &#8220;that there&#8217;s a bullet comes now
and then from over there to the right.
One of the braves must have a rifle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Moccasin Williams,&#8221; replied Kit
Carson, from behind a near-by tree. &#8220;He&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
behind that big cottonwood at the mouth of
the ravine, trying some sharpshooting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to get a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; but Dave never
finished the sentence, for Kit&#8217;s rifle cracked
and the bark flew from the big cottonwood
in a shower, leaving a deep seam to show
the track of the bullet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Missed!&#8221; said Kit, coolly. &#8220;But better
luck next time.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a little while the Indians pressed
forward under cover; then, thinking themselves
near enough for a rush, they leaped
from behind the trees and with shrill yells
and brandished hatchets and knives, darted
at the trappers.</p>

<p>The long rifles greeted them once more;
but as they still came on, the pistols were
discharged in their very faces with terrible
effect. This was more than savage fortitude
could bear up under, and they sought cover
once more with howls of rage and a fresh
flight of arrows.</p>

<p>Then closer and closer they drew and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
slower and slower grew the fire of the
whites. There were but few charges of
powder left. Another rush of the savages,
and there would be no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks bad,&#8221; said old Zeke, as he drained
his powder-horn of its last grain. &#8220;But we&#8217;ll
give a good account of ourselves for all.&#8221;</p>

<p>But a last desperate struggle with knife
and clubbed rifle was not to come, for as the
powder was quite exhausted, word was
brought to Kit that the reserve of trappers
under Fontenelle had arrived. And soon
after, each horn was refilled, each rifle recharged,
and with the confidence of increased
numbers the trappers advanced,
firing as they went.</p>

<p>In the van of the whites was the half-breed,
Lopez; he held his rifle ready, but
seemed to reserve his fire. Kit Carson,
firing and loading and firing and loading,
noticed this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything wrong with your shooting
iron, Spotted Snake?&#8221; asked the trapper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the half-breed, never taking
his eyes from the flitting line of savages
as they moved from cover to cover. &#8220;But
the bullet that&#8217;s in it is meant for Moccasin
Williams, and him only.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steadily the trappers pressed forward;
quicker and quicker grew the flitting of the
savages from rock to tree and from tree to
stump; and at length the crafty retreat
began to weaken, then to waver. There
was less purpose in it; finally the braves at
one side broke and ran; then the entire
line followed suit.</p>

<p>Now for the first time since he entered
the action, the rifle of Lopez lifted. The
boys saw an ungainly white man in the
rush of the fleeing savages; he had sandy
hair and a thin, fox-like face. A dozen
steps he took, the fox-face turned over his
shoulder to observe the pursuers, then
Lopez&#8217; piece crashed and the man pitched
forward to the ground.</p>

<p>With a shrill, throaty cry of exultation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
Lopez darted forward; the boys saw him
reach the prostrate form, a knife in his
hand. But as he bent over it the form
showed unexpected life. Moccasin Williams
sprang to his feet, drawing an Indian
hatchet from his belt as he did so, and
both men struck at each other. Both
blows took effect; then their arms encircled
each other, there was a frenzied clutching
at each other&#8217;s throats, and they fell to the
earth.</p>

<p>And when Kit Carson returned from the
pursuit of the Indians, which was but a
short one, he found the boys standing above
the two dead bodies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your property?&#8221; he asked, his swift
eyes telling him what had occurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Joe, and he held up a
folded paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said the trapper. &#8220;Take care
of it, for you&#8217;ve had a hard fight to get it
back; and the next time you might not be
so lucky.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>The blow dealt the Blackfeet that day
was a heavy one; and they remembered it,
as Zeke Matthews had prophesied, for a
long time after.</p>

<p>Great good luck followed the Fontenelle
band in their labors after this; and when
they finally journeyed to the trading camp,
held that year on Mud River, they took
with them a great wealth of furs.</p>

<p>And it was on Mud River, some weeks
later, that Kit Carson parted with the boys,
who proposed to join an ingoing party as
far as Santa F&eacute;, and then take ship at one
of the Gulf ports for New York.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, lads,&#8221; he said, as he pressed
their hands. &#8220;Some day I may go east,
and if I ever do, I&#8217;ll be sure to look you
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;East!&#8221; exclaimed Joe. &#8220;West, you
mean, Kit. In a year we&#8217;ll be in California
again, digging and washing along that
wonderful river which, as old Goat Beard
said, runs with gold.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>And Joe was right as to place. But he
was wrong about the time.</p>

<p>The next time the three met it was in
California; but fifteen years or more had
passed. The boys had become bronzed men
and were accounted the richest in the New
Eldorado. And Kit Carson was then the
most famous man in the great west; his
fame as an Indian fighter and pathfinder
had gone around the globe.</p>

<p>&#8220;You found your river of gold then,&#8221;
said he, as they gripped hands once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed Dave. &#8220;It proved to be
the Sacramento.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we had to wait until the United
States took California over, after the war
with Mexico,&#8221; said Joe, rather ruefully.
&#8220;It was a long time, but,&#8221; and his eyes
laughed much as they used to do, &#8220;it was
worth the waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think so, indeed,&#8221; said the
trapper.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>SKETCH OF CARSON&#8217;S LIFE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Christopher</span> or &#8220;Kit&#8221; Carson was born
in Madison County, Kentucky, in December,
1809. The great state had been opened
only a few years and was, in many parts,
still a trackless wilderness.</p>

<p>Kit was reared in the log house of the
frontier; and like most noted frontiersmen
grew accustomed to the rifle at an early age.</p>

<p>But however primitive Kentucky may
have been there were apparently too many
settlers to please the elder Carson; for a
year after the birth of Kit, he packed his
effects upon the backs of his horses, and with
his family took up the trail for the more
distant west. They crossed the Mississippi
and settled in that vast country later ceded
by Napoleon to the United States, and
then known as Upper Louisiana.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>Here Kit grew up among the wild spirits
of the border, accustomed to the idea of
danger and renowned even in his boyhood
as a rifle shot, a hunter and the possessor of
invincible resolution. He served two years
as apprentice to a saddler; then the stories
of the Santa F&eacute; trail, the dangers and
wonders thereof, appealed to him so strongly
that he joined a party about to start over it.</p>

<p>This was the day when vast herds of
buffalo roamed the great plains, when the
Rocky Mountains were almost a thing of
fable. And at the age of eighteen we find
Kit Carson in the Mexican city of Santa F&eacute;,
with the whirl of the wonderful southwest
all about him. The fur trade was approaching
its height and the commerce of the
prairies had centered about the town. To
it came all the wonderful characters of the
border, and from it started more expeditions
than from any other city in the west.</p>

<p>Young Carson fell in love with the wild
country; with rifle, hatchet and knife, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
penetrated the hills to the north and there
fell in with Kin Cade, an old mountaineer
who taught him much of the lore of the
West which afterward proved so useful to
him. Later, Kit joined the train of a trader
going back to Missouri. The Santa F&eacute; trail
was a thousand miles long, and through a
savage region of wolves and Indians, and
waterless deserts. But Kit did not mind
this; he liked the toil of it and the danger.
But, half-way over the trail, the thought
came to him that he was going back &#8220;East.&#8221;
At a ford on the Arkansas River they
encountered another band of traders on
their way to the west; Kit joined them and
returned to Santa F&eacute;. Reaching the fur
market once more, Young Carson engaged
with a Colonel Trammel, who was leading a
trading expedition southward to the rich
mines of Chihuahua. Having learned
Spanish from Kin Cade, he was now to
serve as interpreter.</p>

<p>Returning from this venture he went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Taos, a trapper&#8217;s town about a hundred and
fifty miles north of Santa F&eacute;. Here he met
the trapper, Ewing Young, for the first
time, and was engaged as a camp cook.
But Young was not long in seeing the qualities
of his youthful recruit, and when he
took up his march for California, where we
find his party in the first chapter of &#8220;In
the Rockies with Kit Carson,&#8221; Kit was a
full fledged trapper.</p>

<p>After the great battle with the Blackfeet,
as related in the last chapter of the story,
Kit Carson joined a body of trappers at the
summer rendezvous. Later he joined a
trading party going into the country of the
Navajos, a highly intelligent tribe who cultivated
the arts and were quite rich. After
a profitable venture among these people he
became the hunter, or meat provider for the
fort on the Platte River.</p>

<p>But he preferred trapping, it would seem;
and after some smaller ventures joined a
large party and once more ventured into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
the Blackfoot country. In the winter traces
of Indians were seen near their camp;
knowing that the savages must be in large
force to venture so near to them, Kit Carson
proposed that the whites strike the first
blow, and so plant terror in the hearts of
the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>Forty trappers took the trail; Kit was
given the command. A band of savages
were encountered and attacked. They fled,
falling back upon a still larger band. A
desperate battle followed, fought from behind
trees and rocks, and as night fell, the
Blackfeet, with many of their braves dead
or disabled, retired across a frozen stream
to an island in its middle, where they had
erected a log fort. Under the cover of the
darkness, however, the Indians left even
this and hurried away.</p>

<p>Returning to camp a council was held.
The trappers were sure the savages would
return in great numbers, and they began to
prepare for them. Intrenchments were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
prepared; trees, brush, stumps, fallen logs
and boulders were cleared away from the
camp upon every side. If the savages advanced,
they must do so in the open.</p>

<p>At daybreak one morning the Indians
came, a thousand or more in number, and
advanced to crush the whites for good and
all. But at the verge of the cleared space
they halted, astonished. They could not
advance without exposing themselves to the
deadly fire of the long rifles; to take the
fort meant an awful sacrifice. A council
was held in which there was much speech-making.
Then the host broke into two
bands and moved away over the mountains;
and after this that particular body of trappers
were troubled no more.</p>

<p>But Kit was destined to have many encounters
with the Blackfeet and other hostile
tribes; and at the same time there were
numerous others with whom he became
quite friendly; indeed, many was the village
into which he could ride and be greeted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
as a brother. In spite of all the opposition
of the Indians of the mountains, the trappers
persisted. But at length the price of
furs fell to such a degree that hunting them
grew unprofitable. And so Kit abandoned
the pursuit and began a career as a hunter,
during which he pushed his acquaintance
with the nations of the Cheyennes, the
Kiowas, the Arapahoes and the Comanches.
Once he was instrumental in preventing a
deadly war between the powerful Sioux
people and the Comanche. The Sioux had
intruded upon the hunting ground of the
other tribe; this was resented; fights followed;
the Comanches were beaten. Kit
Carson was the friend of both peoples; he
went to their chiefs; he parleyed and
argued. The result was that the Sioux left
the Comanche hunting ground, their chiefs
giving their word that they&#8217;d never return.</p>

<p>Among the Comanches, Kit Carson found
a wife&mdash;a beautiful Indian girl with a mind
much superior to that of the women of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
race. They had a daughter. Afterward
the wife and mother died of a plague which
had broken out; and when the child grew
a little older, Kit took her to St. Louis to be
educated and brought up amidst civilized
surroundings.</p>

<p>Bound up the Missouri River from St.
Louis, Kit fell in with Lieutenant John C.
Fr&eacute;mont, of the Topographical Engineers
Corps. This officer had been sent by the
War Department to explore on the line of
the Kansas and Great Platte Rivers, and
between the South Pass in the Rockies and
the frontier of Missouri. Fr&eacute;mont had a
party of twenty-one boatmen who knew the
western life; he had also engaged a guide,
but this latter man had failed him. Learning
this, Kit Carson offered his services as
one who knew the mountains and streams,
having trapped among them for sixteen
years. He was accepted; and thus began
that series of explorations that made the
name of Fr&eacute;mont, the pathfinder, known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
the country over, and that of Kit Carson,
frontiersman, famous throughout the world.</p>

<p>Three separate expeditions into the wilds
were required before Fr&eacute;mont completed
his work, and in each of these Kit Carson
acted as his guide. They were expeditions
crowded with Indian battles, with perils and
escapes by flood and field.</p>

<p>After years of adventure, Kit began to
farm and raise sheep, organizing a hunting
party of his old friends now and then; later
the government, because of his knowledge
of the tribes, made him an Indian agent.</p>

<p>This difficult post he filled as probably it
had never been filled before. During the
rebellion he was of much service to the government
on the border; and at the close of
the war was breveted a brigadier general of
volunteers. He died at Fort Lyon, Colorado,
in May, 1868, in the sixtieth year of
his age.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
